# First Login

After creating your Kenko account, your first login experience will guide you through essential setup steps and introduce you to the platform. This guide walks you through what to expect and how to navigate the system, including adding a new location to your business.

## Accessing Your Account

```

If enabled, you'll be prompted to enter a verification code sent to your mobile device or email. Review and accept the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy if prompted.

## First-Time Setup Wizard

Upon your first login, you'll be guided through a setup wizard to ensure everything is ready for you to start using Kenko

Once you've completed the setup wizard, you'll be able to navigate the platform. Your dashboard will give you an overview of your business operations, including upcoming classes, member activity, and financial data. Use the \*\*Contact Management\*\* section to add and manage your clients, track attendance, and view activity histories. Go to the \*\*Scheduling\*\* module to manage classes, appointments, and courses for your business locations.
