# Setting up Reserve with Google (RwG)

Reserve with Google (RwG) lets potential clients book classes and appointments directly from your studio's Google listing — dramatically expanding your online visibility and reducing friction in customer acquisition.

## What is Reserve with Google?

RwG is an integration that allows customers to book services directly via your Google Business Profile. When someone finds your business on Google Search or Maps, they can book directly from the search results.
