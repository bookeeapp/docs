# Journeys: Building Blocks

Kenko Journeys are powered by a **drag-and-drop builder** that lets you visually map out automated workflows across different communication channels. These workflows, called Journeys, are composed of **Blocks** — the foundational units that define actions, logic, and content inside a journey.

This guide explains each type of block, how they work, and how to use them to build powerful, personalized automation workflows.

## Types of Journey Blocks

<Info>
  Use a combination of these blocks to create sophisticated, contextual journeys for maximum client engagement.
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Rules Block" icon="bolt">
    Rule blocks are the **logic engines** of your journey — they determine who qualifies for the journey or which path they follow next.

    Use filters such as:

    - Membership status
    - Pricing options purchased
    - Tags assigned to contact
    - Visit or class count

    ![Rules Block](/images/Block\(3\).png)

    <Info>
      You can also set timing conditions like "wait X days after purchase" or "trigger if no booking in 7 days."
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email Block" icon="envelope">
    Use drag-and-drop tools to craft branded emails that drive engagement and action.

    - Personalize content with variables (name, service, etc.)
    - Track open, click, and delivery performance
    - Add fallback channels if the email goes unopened

    ![Email Block](/images/Block\(4\).png)

    <Tip>
      Great for newsletters, onboarding sequences, milestone check-ins, and upsell offers.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SMS Block" icon="comment-dots">
    SMS is powerful for quick, timely messages — high open rates, instant delivery.

    - Perfect for reminders, confirmations, and flash promos
    - Add personalization with name, session info, and more
    - Supports fallback if not delivered

    <Tip>
      Keep messages short, actionable, and compliant with opt-in regulations.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Push Notification Block" icon="bell">
    Push blocks allow you to send in-app messages to users of your branded mobile app.

    - Alert members about class spots, new videos, or offers
    - Ideal for re-engagement without email/SMS costs
    - Set conditions for timing and frequency

    <Tip>
      Use these sparingly for important updates or time-sensitive nudges.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Wait Block" icon="clock">
    Wait blocks delay the next step in your journey.

    - Fixed delay: “Wait 3 days”
    - Conditional delay: “Wait until booking is made”
    - Timed delay: “Wait until 9 AM on a weekday”

    ![Wait Block](/images/Block\(5\).png)

    <Tip>
      Use this to pace out messages and avoid overwhelming clients.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tag Block" icon="tag">
    Tags allow dynamic segmentation and logic within your journey.

    - Apply or remove tags based on user actions
    - Trigger automations or eligibility based on tags
    - Use tags to power audience-specific campaigns

    ![Tag Block](/images/Block\(6\).png)

    <Tip>
      Use tags to track trial completion, drop-offs, referrals, or engagement levels.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connecting Blocks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drag & Drop">
    Select a block from the left-side menu in the Journey Builder and drop it onto the canvas.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Blocks">
    Click on the arrow from one block and drag it to another. This creates a directional flow.

    ![Connect Block Pn](/images/ConnectBlock.png)

    <div className="flex justify-center" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Kenko supports **parallel paths** — clients can continue down two flows simultaneously if configured that way.
</Info>

## Understanding Rule Matching

Rule blocks define conditional logic. Here's how matching behavior works:

| Behavior        | Explanation                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Matched**     | Contact satisfies the rule's condition (e.g., purchased a plan, completed a visit). Moves down the "matched" path. |
| **Not Matched** | Contact doesn't meet the rule's condition. Moves down an alternate (fallback) path or exits the journey.           |

<Info>
  Fallbacks ensure that even if a user doesn't match a rule, they still experience a meaningful journey.
</Info>

## Advanced Features

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Implicit vs Explicit Waiting" icon="hourglass">
    Implicit waits are handled by rule blocks with a time window (e.g., wait 3 days to see if they take an action).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fallback Paths" icon="shuffle">
    If a user doesn’t meet the rule condition, fallback paths can be used to send them a different message or exit them from the journey.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Progression Control" icon="route">
    Each journey defines how customers enter, proceed, exit, or achieve a goal.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Special Actions" icon="settings">
    Pause, resume, duplicate, or delete journeys at any time. Pausing prevents new contacts from entering, but existing ones still progress.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Journey Analytics

Monitor journey health, engagement, and conversion rates with **Journey Analytics**.

![Screenshot2025 05 05at6 56 09PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-05at6.56.09PM.png)

| Metric           | Meaning                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Audience Entered | Number of contacts who started the journey             |
| Conversion Rate  | % of contacts who completed the journey goal           |
| Drop-off Rate    | % who exited midway or disengaged                      |
| Email Metrics    | Open rates, click-through rates, bounces, unsubscribes |

<Info>
  Review Analytics every week to refine entry rules, wait times, and messaging.

## Journey Performance

Kenko tracks the journey lifecycle in real time:

| Status       | Meaning                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Started      | Contact entered based on the entry rule               |
| In Progress  | Contact is currently going through the journey        |
| Finished     | Contact completed all blocks                          |
| Exited       | Contact left early (rule-based exit)                  |
| Disengaged   | Contact removed due to bounce, spam, or rule mismatch |
| Goal Reached | Contact achieved the defined journey goal             |
