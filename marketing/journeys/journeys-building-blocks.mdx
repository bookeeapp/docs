# Journeys: Building Blocks

Kenko Journeys are powered by a **drag-and-drop builder** that lets you visually map out automated workflows across different communication channels. These workflows, called Journeys, are composed of **Blocks** — the foundational units that define actions, logic, and content inside a journey.

This guide explains each type of block, how they work, and how to use them to build powerful, personalized automation workflows.

## Types of Journey Blocks

<Info>
Use a combination of these blocks to create sophisticated, contextual journeys for maximum client engagement.
</Info>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Rule Block" icon="filter">
    Rule blocks are logic gates — they determine **who enters a journey** or moves down a specific path. You can filter based on customer properties, such as:

    - Membership status
    - Visit count
    - Pricing options purchased
    - Tag-based segmentation

    ![Block(3) Pn](/images/Block\(3\).png)

    <div className="flex justify-center" />

    <Info>
      You can define wait times in rule blocks to allow users time to complete certain actions (e.g., open an email or purchase a plan).
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Communication Blocks" icon="envelope-open">
    These are the **messages** you want to send: emails, SMS, and push notifications. Currently, only email is available (SMS & push are coming soon).

    - Use drag-and-drop editor to create rich emails
    - Monitor open rates, click-throughs, and delivery stats
    - Each message can have timing and fallback conditions

    ![Block(4) Pn](/images/Block\(4\).png)

    <Info>
      Use email blocks in combination with **Wait** and **Rule** blocks to control the timing and audience for each message.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Wait Block" icon="clock">
    The **Wait block** defines how long to pause before proceeding to the next step.

    - Simple Wait: “Wait 3 days”
    - Advanced Wait: Wait until a specific time or condition is met (like after completing a visit or making a purchase)

    ![Block(5) Pn](/images/Block\(5\).png)

    <Info>
      Use this to **space out communications** and create natural progression between actions.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Tag Block" icon="tag">
    Apply or remove tags to contacts dynamically. This is powerful for

    - Segmenting contacts in reports
    - Setting prerequisites for classes, courses, or promotions
    - Triggering other automation based on tags

    You can only use **existing tags**. If you add a new tag, allow up to 90 minutes for it to sync.

    ![Block(6) Pn](/images/Block\(6\).png)

    <Tip>
      Use tags to **track user progression**, apply discount access, or remove users from other journeys.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Connecting Blocks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drag & Drop">
    Select a block from the left-side menu in the Journey Builder and drop it onto the canvas.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Blocks">
    Click on the arrow from one block and drag it to another. This creates a directional flow.

    ![Connect Block Pn](/images/ConnectBlock.png)

    <div className="flex justify-center" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Kenko supports **parallel paths** — clients can continue down two flows simultaneously if configured that way.
</Info>

## Understanding Rule Matching

Rule blocks define conditional logic. Here's how matching behavior works:

| Behavior        | Explanation |
|-----------------|--------------|
| **Matched**     | Contact satisfies the rule's condition (e.g., purchased a plan, completed a visit). Moves down the "matched" path. |
| **Not Matched** | Contact doesn't meet the rule's condition. Moves down an alternate (fallback) path or exits the journey. |

<Info>
Fallbacks ensure that even if a user doesn't match a rule, they still experience a meaningful journey.
</Info>

## Advanced Features

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Implicit vs Explicit Waiting" icon="hourglass">
    Implicit waits are handled by rule blocks with a time window (e.g., wait 3 days to see if they take an action).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fallback Paths" icon="shuffle">
    If a user doesn’t meet the rule condition, fallback paths can be used to send them a different message or exit them from the journey.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Progression Control" icon="route">
    Each journey defines how customers enter, proceed, exit, or achieve a goal.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Special Actions" icon="settings">
    Pause, resume, duplicate, or delete journeys at any time. Pausing prevents new contacts from entering, but existing ones still progress.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Journey Analytics

Monitor journey health, engagement, and conversion rates with **Journey Analytics**.

| Metric          | Meaning                                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Audience Entered | Number of contacts who started the journey         |
| Conversion Rate | % of contacts who completed the journey goal       |
| Drop-off Rate   | % who exited midway or disengaged                   |
| Email Metrics   | Open rates, click-through rates, bounces, unsubscribes |

<Info>
Review Analytics every week to refine entry rules, wait times, and messaging.

## Journey Performance

Kenko tracks the journey lifecycle in real time:

| Status       | Meaning                                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Started      | Contact entered based on the entry rule               |
| In Progress  | Contact is currently going through the journey        |
| Finished     | Contact completed all blocks                          |
| Exited       | Contact left early (rule-based exit)                  |
| Disengaged   | Contact removed due to bounce, spam, or rule mismatch |
| Goal Reached | Contact achieved the defined journey goal             |

<Info>
  You can view real-time analytics on block performance (email opens, clicks, deliveries) and contact progression using **Journey Analytics**.

## Before You Go Live

- ✅ All blocks should be connected

- ✅ Review fallback paths for every rule block

Once live, you can monitor performance in **Journey Analytics** and iterate based on actual behavior.
