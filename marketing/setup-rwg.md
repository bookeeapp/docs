# Setup Rwg

Reserve with Google (RwG) lets potential clients book classes and appointments directly from your studio's Google listing — dramatically expanding your online visibility and reducing friction in customer acquisition.

## What is Reserve with Google?

RwG is an integration that allows customers to book services directly via your Google Business Profile. When someone finds your business on Google Search or Maps, they can book directly from the search results.

## **Key Benefits**

Make it easier for new clients to discover and schedule services without visiting your website. Remove booking steps — your services show up where people are already searching. Tap into Google's massive search traffic at no added cost. View conversion data and user behavior directly inside your RwG dashboard.

## Typical Use Cases

Capture leads who are actively searching for studios or services near them. Enable quick bookings for intro offers or high-demand classes. Support last-minute scheduling and drop-ins. Improve conversion rates from Google Maps searches.

## RwG Dashboard

Once your services go live, Kenko shows you detailed analytics:

| Metric             | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Impressions        | Number of people who saw your services on Google |
| Clicks             | Number of users who clicked the "Book" button    |
| Conversion %       | Ratio of bookings vs total impressions           |
| Service-wise Split | Which services are getting the most traction     |

RwG dashboard auto-updates daily based on Google-provided stats.

## Best Practices

Ensure your hours, phone, address, and name are consistent across platforms to improve Google verification. Choose trial offers, intro packs, or your best-selling services for maximum ROI. Descriptions synced to Google should clearly explain what the client is booking. Use Kenko's RwG dashboard to track what's working and update service visibility accordingly. Kenko does not charge any fees to sync with Google. Setup takes \~5 minutes and brings long-term conversion benefits. Need help syncing your profile?
