# A2P 10DLC & Custom Email Setup

To run successful and compliant campaigns in Kenko, you must set up two foundational elements:

- **A2P 10DLC registration** to legally send SMS in the U.S.
- **Custom email configuration** to improve brand deliverability and sender trust.

## A2P 10DLC Registration

### What is A2P 10DLC?

A2P (Application-to-Person) 10DLC is a regulatory system by U.S. mobile carriers to authenticate business messaging over 10-digit long codes. All SMS messages to U.S. numbers must go through this framework.

<Info>
  If you send any promotional or transactional SMS messages to U.S.-based phone numbers, A2P 10DLC registration is mandatory.

### U.S. Registration Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Register Your Brand">
    Provide legal business information including EIN, address, and website.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Submit Use Cases">
    Define the types of campaigns you’ll send (e.g. marketing, transactional).
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Connect Phone Numbers">
    Link your 10-digit long code (10DLC) to each campaign use case.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Wait for Approval">
    Carriers typically take 3–5 business days to verify the submission.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  You can register directly via Twilio, Telnyx, or through Kenko’s integrations with supported carriers. For Twilio-specific instructions, refer to [this Twilio Help Article](https://help.twilio.com/articles/1260801864489-How-do-I-register-to-use-A2P-10DLC-messaging).
</Info>

<Accordion title="When is a message considered 'matched' or 'unmatched'?" icon="question">
  Matched messages are those that comply with your registered campaign use case (e.g., a confirmation message sent through a "Transactional" campaign). Unmatched messages may be blocked, throttled, or penalized for violating the declared purpose.
</Accordion>

### For Other Countries (UK, EU, Canada, AU, etc.)

While A2P 10DLC specifically applies to U.S. carriers, other countries have their own messaging compliance systems:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="United Kingdom" icon="flag">
    The UK uses sender ID registration for business SMS. Work with your provider (e.g., Vonage, Infobip) to register a branded alphanumeric ID.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="European Union" icon="globe">
    GDPR compliance is required for all messaging. Ensure opt-in consent and unsubscribe mechanisms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Canada" icon="leaf-maple">
    CASL governs SMS/email—ensure prior consent before sending messages. A2P via shortcodes is most common.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Australia & New Zealand" icon="star">
    Similar to Canada, these regions follow strict consent guidelines and support shortcode registration for A2P.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Callout type="info">
Kenko recommends using carrier-compliant gateways (e.g., Twilio, Telnyx) which automatically manage country-specific regulations.

## Custom Email Domain Setup

Using a custom email (e.g., [hello@yourstudio.com](mailto:hello@yourstudio.com)) enhances deliverability and keeps your communications on brand.

### Why Set It Up?

- Ensures higher inbox placement (vs spam folders)
- Authenticates your brand domain (SPF/DKIM)
- Increases customer trust when opening emails

### Setup Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Buy a Domain">
    Use providers like Google Domains, Namecheap, or GoDaddy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Connect to an Email Provider">
    Services like Google Workspace, Zoho, or Outlook are commonly used.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Configure SPF/DKIM">
    Add required DNS records from your provider to authenticate outbound mail.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Verify in Kenko">
    Go to `Settings > Email Configuration` and input SMTP or domain info.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  If you skip this setup, your campaigns will go from a Kenko shared email address, which can impact open and deliverability rates.
