# Campaign Analytics Overview in Kenko

After launching an email campaign in Kenko, you can track its effectiveness directly from the **Analytics** tab. This view breaks down key metrics and recipient activity to help you optimize future sends.

## Performance Metrics Explained

Each campaign report begins with a high-level summary of delivery and engagement
