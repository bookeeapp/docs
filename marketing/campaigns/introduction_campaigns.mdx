# Campaigns Overview

Kenko's **Campaigns** feature is built for direct, targeted outreach to your customers. Unlike automated Journeys, Campaigns are manual one-off or scheduled messages designed to announce, promote, or inform.

Use Campaigns to drive immediate action, promote new offers, fill empty classes, and boost engagement through personalized communication channels.
