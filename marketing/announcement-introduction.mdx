# Announcements Overview

Kenko’s **Announcements** feature enables you to broadcast time-sensitive messages directly within the app to your members. Whether you're running a flash sale, updating studio hours, or announcing a new class — announcements help you cut through the noise and reach your clients instantly.

## Impact on Engagement

<info>
  Announcements typically see 4–6x higher visibility compared to email campaigns.

- **Higher open rates**: Since they’re native to the app, members are more likely to read them.
- **Immediate action**: Pair with direct links to drive bookings, purchases, or sign-ups.
