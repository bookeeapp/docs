# Creating Announcements in Kenko

Kenko's **Announcements** module helps studios communicate key updates directly inside the app — from schedule changes and location-specific promotions to event launches and emergency alerts.

These announcements appear in your clients' app and can be shown as

<CardGroup cols="3">
  <Card title="Detailed Card" icon="newspaper">
    Best for event promotions, class updates, and anything with detailed content. Appears on the home screen with image and description.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Banner" icon="megaphone">
    Ideal for short alerts or urgent messages. Appears above home screen sections.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Push Notification" icon="bell">
    Great for nudging inactive users or highlighting new launches. Pops up on user's mobile lock screen.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Each announcement includes live preview functionality so you know exactly how it will appear to users.

## Best Practices for Announcements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep It Short and Relevant" icon="pen">
    Titles and short descriptions should be concise. Capture user attention in a single glance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Visuals Thoughtfully" icon="image">
    Always upload a clear, brand-consistent image. Maintain the minimum dimensions (375px x 168px) to ensure optimal rendering.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time Your Message Well" icon="clock">
    Schedule announcements to match your studio’s operational rhythm — avoid off-hours and target active app usage times.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Leverage CTA for Conversions" icon="arrow-pointer">
    Include a Call to Action when driving bookings, offers, or website visits. Keep CTA text action-oriented like “Join Now” or “See Schedule.”
