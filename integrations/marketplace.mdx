## Troubleshooting

If something seems off, here’s where to start

- **Schedule Sync Issues**: Double-check your Kenko schedule visibility and publishing status.
- **Capacity Mismatch**: Make sure marketplace spot limits are within your overall class capacity.
- **Check-In Problems**: Ensure your front desk team is trained on verifying external check-ins.
- **Billing Questions**: Review consolidated reports from each platform and cross-check with Kenko payout logs.
