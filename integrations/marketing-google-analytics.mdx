# Google Analytics Integration in Kenko

Ever wondered what people _actually_ do on your website? Like—do they check your class schedule, read about your instructors, or just bounce after 3 seconds?

That’s exactly the kind of mystery Google Analytics was born to solve.

When paired with Kenko, Google Analytics (GA4 to be exact) becomes your 24/7 behavior detective. It tells you who’s coming in, where they’re from, what they’re doing, and most importantly—whether your marketing is working.

## Why Integrate Google Analytics?

You can’t improve what you don’t measure. Integrating GA4 with Kenko gives you

- **User Behavior Insights** – Understand how people explore your site and where they drop off.
- **Attribution Clarity** – Know which channels are actually driving bookings (SEO, Instagram, Google Ads?).
- **Conversion Funnel Visibility** – See how visitors progress from interest → intent → action.
- **Data You Can Act On** – Whether it’s optimizing pages or spending smarter on ads, GA gives you the confidence to make bold moves.
