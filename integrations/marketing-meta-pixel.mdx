# Meta Pixel Integration in Kenko

You’ve run your ads, people are visiting your website... but who are they? What are they doing? Did they _almost_ book a class and vanish? This is where Meta Pixel swoops in like a superhero for your marketing team.

When combined with Kenko, Meta Pixel becomes a powerful weapon to sharpen targeting, boost return on ad spend (ROAS), and convert curious scrollers into loyal customers.

## Why Integrate Meta Pixel?

Meta Pixel is more than just a tracker — it’s your backstage pass to audience behavior. It allows you to

- **Track Conversions**: Know when people take actions like booking a class, subscribing to a plan, or completing a payment.
- **Optimize Ads**: Identify what content, creative, or campaign brings the best ROI — and double down on what works.
- **Retarget Visitors**: That visitor who bounced just before checkout? You can now gently nudge them back with a personalized ad.
- **Build Lookalike Audiences**: Target new users who behave like your best customers. Meta’s algorithms will thank you later.

When plugged into Kenko, the Pixel doesn’t just listen — it understands. You’ll have actionable insights, not just raw data.

## Setting Up Meta Pixel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Pixel" icon="plus">
    Head to [Meta Events Manager](https://www.facebook.com/events_manager2/list), click "Connect Data Sources" → "Web" → "Meta Pixel", give your Pixel a name, and link it to your site. It only takes a minute to get started.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the Pixel Code" icon="code">
    Meta gives you a tiny snippet of JavaScript. Paste it into the `<head>` section of your website. If you’re using a CMS (like WordPress or Shopify), there’s a plugin for that.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Installation" icon="check">
    Download the [Meta Pixel Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meta-pixel-helper/fdgfkebogiimcoedlicjlajpkdmockpc) Chrome extension to confirm it’s working. You’ll see green checks when events start flowing in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Events" icon="gear">
    Use Meta’s Event Setup Tool to mark key actions like "Add to Cart" or "Book Now" — no code required. For advanced setups, you can use the Conversions API to track server-side events too.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable in Kenko" icon="toggle-large-on">
    In Kenko’s admin panel, go to Marketing Settings → Meta Pixel. Paste your Pixel ID, and Kenko will do the heavy lifting — mapping your customer actions to Meta’s event model.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Integrating Meta Pixel with Kenko

When you connect Meta Pixel through Kenko, you're not just dropping code — you're syncing two intelligent systems.

- **Automated Setup**: No need to manually tag buttons or pages. Kenko handles that behind the scenes.
- **Event Mapping**: Actions like class booking, trial activation, or payment are automatically sent to Meta as standard events.
- **Improved Data Quality**: With consistent, real-time event capture, you avoid missed conversions or incomplete funnels.

It’s plug-and-play marketing intelligence — with real results.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Define Clear Objectives" icon="bullseye">
    Before you dive into setup, ask yourself: What do I want to measure? Whether it’s lead capture, trial pack redemptions, or class bookings, a clear goal helps you define and prioritize events in Meta Pixel — so you’re tracking what truly matters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Standard Events" icon="stairs">
    Stick with Meta’s standard events like `Lead`, `Purchase`, or `CompleteRegistration`. They’re easier to report on, play nicely with ad optimization, and save your developers (and yourself) a lot of time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enable Advanced Matching" icon="arrow-down-up-across-line">
    Don’t settle for cookies alone. Advanced matching lets you send hashed customer details (like emails or phone numbers) to Meta — increasing match rates and improving tracking accuracy, even with iOS privacy restrictions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regularly Monitor Performance" icon="eye">
    Open Meta Events Manager weekly and check what’s firing (and what’s not). Keep an eye on deduplicated events, fire counts, and any unusual drops — it's your early warning system for broken journeys.
