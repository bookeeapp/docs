✨ **Direct Customer Access** – Customers can reach you instantly through the messaging app they use daily. No more missed emails or voicemails.

📈 **Higher Engagement** – WhatsApp messages have a 98% open rate (compared to 20% for email). Your messages actually get read.

🏢 **Professional Presence** – Show up as a verified business with your own WhatsApp Business number. Build trust and credibility with every message.

🔄 **Unified Inbox** – All WhatsApp conversations flow into your inbox alongside email, SMS, and chat. Everything in one place, so nothing falls through the cracks.

🤖 **Automated Workflows** – Set up journeys that automatically send appointment reminders, order updates, and personalized messages. Save time while staying connected.

### Getting Started: Your 3-Step Setup

Setting up WhatsApp is straightforward. Follow these three simple steps and you'll be messaging customers in minutes.

#### Step 1: Create Your Business Account

* [ ] Go to your inbox settings and click **"Connect to WhatsApp"**
* [ ] You'll see a signup form. Click **"Create a New Business Account"**
* [ ] Follow the prompts to set up your WhatsApp Business Account
* [ ] Complete the verification process (this usually takes just a few minutes)

> 💡 **What to expect:** You'll need basic business information for verification. Have your business details handy to make this go smoothly.

#### Step 2: Get Your Phone Number

* [ ] Once your business account is ready, you'll need a WhatsApp phone number
* [ ] Click **"Purchase Number"** in your WhatsApp settings
* [ ] Search for available numbers in your region
* [ ] **No numbers available in your region?** No problem! Purchase a US number instead
* [ ] Select your number and complete the purchase

> 💡 **Pro tip:** If possible, choose a number that's easy to remember or matches your existing business phone number. This makes it easier for customers to recognize you.

> 🌍 **Global messaging:** WhatsApp works globally, so a US number works perfectly for messaging customers anywhere in the world.

#### Step 3: Link Your Number to a Location

* [ ] After purchasing your number, click **"Setup Inbox"**
* [ ] Your number will be linked to that specific location
* [ ] Wait a moment for the setup to complete

> ⚠️ **Important:** Each location needs its own unique WhatsApp number. If you have multiple locations, purchase and set up a separate number for each one.

> ✅ **You're done when:** You'll see a status indicator showing your WhatsApp inbox is "Active." Once you see that green status, you're ready to start messaging!

### Understanding WhatsApp Messaging: The Two Types

WhatsApp has two ways to send messages, and knowing when to use each one is key to success.

#### Quick Comparison

| Feature              | Free-Form Messages                  | Template Messages              |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **When to use**      | Within 24 hours of customer contact | Anytime, no restrictions       |
| **Approval needed?** | ❌ No                                | ✅ Yes (usually quick)          |
| **Best for**         | Conversations, support, Q\&A        | Proactive outreach, automation |
| **Personalization**  | ✅ Full flexibility                  | ✅ Pre-set variables only       |
| **Setup time**       | Instant                             | A few minutes to approve       |

#### 📱 Free-Form Messages (The 24-Hour Window)

**Think of this as:** Having an active conversation with a customer.

**When you can use them:**

* Only within **24 hours** after a customer sends you a message
* Perfect for answering questions, providing support, or having a back-and-forth conversation

**How it works:**

1. A customer messages you first (or responds to one of your template messages)
2. You now have a **24-hour window** to send them free-form messages
3. After 24 hours pass, you can only send approved templates

**Real-world example:**

```
Customer: "What are your hours today?"
You: "We're open 9 AM to 6 PM! Can I help you with anything specific?"
You: "Also, we have a special on [product] if you're interested."
✅ All of this works because you're within the 24-hour window
```

<details>

<summary>📚 Learn more about the 24-hour window</summary>

The 24-hour window starts when:

* A customer sends you a message
* A customer responds to your template message
* A customer clicks a button in an interactive message

The window resets each time the customer contacts you, so you can maintain ongoing conversations easily.

**Pro tip:** Set reminders to respond to customers within the window to keep conversations active!

</details>

#### 📋 Template Messages (Send Anytime)

**Think of this as:** Pre-approved messages you can send whenever you need to.

**When you can use them:**

* **Anytime** – no 24-hour restriction
* Perfect for reaching out to customers who haven't messaged you recently
* Ideal for automated journeys, marketing campaigns, and proactive communication

**How it works:**

1. You create a message template (we'll show you how next)
2. Submit it for approval (usually approved within a few minutes)
3. Once approved, you can send it to any customer at any time

**Real-world example:**

* You want to send appointment reminders to customers who booked last week
* You create an "Appointment Reminder" template
* Once approved, you can send it to anyone, anytime—even if they haven't messaged you in months

**The key difference:** Templates need approval first, but they let you reach customers outside the 24-hour window. Free-form messages are instant but only work within 24 hours of customer contact.

### Creating Your First Template

Templates are your secret weapon for staying connected with customers. Here's how to create them:

#### Step 1: Create Your Template

* [ ] Go to **Settings** → **WhatsApp Templates** → **Create Template**
* [ ] Give your template a clear, descriptive name
* [ ] Choose the right **category** (UTILITY or MARKETING)
* [ ] Write your message in the **Body** field

**Good template names:**

* ✅ "Appointment Reminder"
* ✅ "Order Confirmation"
* ✅ "Welcome Message"
* ✅ "Follow-Up After Service"
* ❌ "Template 1" (too vague)
* ❌ "Message" (not descriptive)

**Category guide:**

| Category      | Use For                | Examples                                               |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **UTILITY**   | Transactional messages | Appointments, orders, updates, confirmations, receipts |
| **MARKETING** | Promotional messages   | Sales, offers, announcements, newsletters, campaigns   |

> 💡 **Naming tip:** Use clear, descriptive names. You'll thank yourself later when you have multiple templates and need to find the right one quickly.

#### Step 2: Add Personalization (Make It Personal)

Make your templates feel personal by adding these variables:

| Variable          | What It Does                  | Example Output    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `{{first_name}}`  | Inserts customer's first name | "Sarah"           |
| `{{last_name}}`   | Inserts customer's last name  | "Johnson"         |
| `{{client_name}}` | Inserts your business name    | "Downtown Clinic" |

**Example template:**

```
Hi {{first_name}}, your appointment at {{client_name}} is confirmed for tomorrow at 2 PM. We're looking forward to seeing you!
```

**What the customer receives:**

```
Hi Sarah, your appointment at Downtown Clinic is confirmed for tomorrow at 2 PM. We're looking forward to seeing you!
```

See how it automatically fills in Sarah's name and your business name? That's the power of personalization!

<details>

<summary>💡 Template examples for different use cases</summary>

**Appointment Confirmation (UTILITY):**

```
Hi {{first_name}}, your appointment at {{client_name}} is confirmed for {{date}} at {{time}}. We'll see you then!
```

**Order Shipped (UTILITY):**

```
Hi {{first_name}}, great news! Your order from {{client_name}} has shipped. Track it here: {{tracking_link}}
```

**Welcome Message (MARKETING):**

```
Welcome to {{client_name}}, {{first_name}}! We're excited to have you. Use code WELCOME20 for 20% off your first order.
```

**Follow-Up (UTILITY):**

```
Hi {{first_name}}, how was your recent visit to {{client_name}}? We'd love to hear your feedback!
```

</details>

#### Step 3: Submit for Approval

* [ ] Review your template one more time to make sure everything looks good
* [ ] Click **"Submit for Approval"**
* [ ] Wait for approval (usually takes a few minutes, but can take up to 24 hours)
* [ ] You'll receive a notification when your template is approved or if any changes are needed

**Approval status timeline:**

| Status          | What It Means      | Typical Time            |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 🟡 **Pending**  | Waiting for review | 2-5 minutes             |
| 🟢 **Approved** | Ready to use!      | 5-30 minutes            |
| 🔴 **Rejected** | Needs changes      | Immediate (with reason) |

> ⏱️ **Approval timeline:** Most templates are approved within a few minutes. If it takes longer, don't worry—this is normal. You'll get notified either way.

### Common Template Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

We've seen these mistakes happen often. Learn from them so your templates get approved the first time!

#### ❌ Mistake #1: Mixing Marketing Language with Utility Templates

**What's wrong:**

```
🎉 Special offer! Book now and save 20%!
```

_(Using this in a UTILITY template)_

**What's right:**

```
Your appointment is confirmed for January 15th at 2 PM.
```

**Why it matters:** UTILITY templates are for transactional messages only. Save the promotions for MARKETING templates.

#### ❌ Mistake #2: Starting or Ending with a Placeholder

**What's wrong:**

```
{{first_name}}, your order is ready!
```

**What's right:**

```
Hi {{first_name}}, your order is ready!
```

**Why it matters:** Templates must start and end with actual text, not variables. Always add a greeting or closing.

#### ❌ Mistake #3: Placing Placeholders Right Next to Each Other

**What's wrong:**

```
Hello {{first_name}}{{last_name}}, welcome!
```

**What's right:**

```
Hello {{first_name}} {{last_name}}, welcome!
```

_(Notice the space between them)_

Or even better:

```
Hello {{first_name}}, welcome to {{client_name}}!
```

**Why it matters:** Variables need to be separated by text. This makes the message more natural and readable anyway.

#### ❌ Mistake #4: Overusing Emojis or Special Characters

**What's wrong:**

```
🎉🎊🎈🎁🎂🎀 Special offer!!! Book NOW and SAVE!!! 🎉🎊🎈
```

**What's right:**

```
Special offer: Book now and save 20% on your next appointment.
```

**Why it matters:** Keep it professional. One or two emojis are fine, but excessive use can get your template rejected.

#### ❌ Mistake #5: Choosing the Wrong Category

**UTILITY templates should:**

* ✅ Be transactional and informative
* ✅ Focus on appointments, orders, updates, confirmations
* ✅ Not include promotional content
* ✅ Be clear and direct

**MARKETING templates should:**

* ✅ Clearly indicate promotional content
* ✅ Include opt-out options when required
* ✅ Follow WhatsApp's marketing guidelines
* ✅ Be engaging but compliant

**Quick decision guide:**

```
Are you trying to sell something?
├─ YES → MARKETING category
└─ NO → UTILITY category

Are you informing about a transaction?
├─ YES → UTILITY category
└─ NO → MARKETING category
```

### What to Do If Your Template Gets Rejected

Don't worry—template rejections happen, and they're easy to fix! Here's your action plan:

#### Step 1: Read the Rejection Reason

WhatsApp will tell you exactly why your template was rejected. Common reasons include:

| Rejection Reason     | What It Means                                      | How Common     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Wrong category       | Used UTILITY for marketing content (or vice versa) | 🔴 Very common |
| Placeholder issues   | Placeholders at start/end or adjacent              | 🟡 Common      |
| Promotional language | Sales language in UTILITY template                 | 🔴 Very common |
| Formatting problems  | Unsupported characters or URLs                     | 🟢 Less common |

#### Step 2: Fix the Issue

Based on the rejection reason, make these common fixes:

* **Wrong category?** → Change it to the correct one (UTILITY vs MARKETING)
* **Promotional language?** → Remove sales language from UTILITY templates
* **Placeholder issues?** → Make sure placeholders aren't at the start/end and aren't adjacent
* **Formatting problems?** → Remove unsupported characters or fix URL formatting

#### Step 3: Create a New Template

You can't edit rejected templates, so create a new one with:

* A slightly different name (e.g., "Appointment Reminder v2")
* The fixes applied
* All the same content, just corrected

#### Step 4: Resubmit

Submit your corrected template for approval again. Most templates get approved on the second try once you fix the issues.

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Keep a simple note of what got rejected and why. This helps you avoid repeating the same mistake. Most rejections are due to category mismatches or placeholder placement—both easy to fix!

<details>

<summary>📋 Template rejection checklist</summary>

Use this checklist when fixing a rejected template:

* [ ] Read the rejection reason carefully
* [ ] Check if category is correct (UTILITY vs MARKETING)
* [ ] Verify no promotional language in UTILITY templates
* [ ] Ensure placeholders aren't at start or end
* [ ] Check placeholders aren't adjacent to each other
* [ ] Remove excessive emojis or special characters
* [ ] Verify URLs are properly formatted (if used)
* [ ] Create new template with fixes
* [ ] Use slightly different name
* [ ] Resubmit for approval

</details>

### Using Templates in Journeys (Automation Made Easy)

Templates aren't just for manual messages—they're perfect for automated journeys that work while you sleep!

#### Setting Up a Journey with WhatsApp

* [ ] Go to **Journeys** → **Create Journey** (or edit an existing one)
* [ ] Add a **WhatsApp Node** to your journey flow
* [ ] Click on the WhatsApp node to configure it
* [ ] Select an **approved template** from the dropdown menu
* [ ] Save your journey

That's it! The template will automatically be used for all outbound messages in this journey step.

#### How Personalization Works in Journeys

The magic happens automatically. When you select a template in a journey:

| Variable          | Automatically Replaced With |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- |
| `{{first_name}}`  | Contact's first name        |
| `{{last_name}}`   | Contact's last name         |
| `{{client_name}}` | Your business name          |

**Real-world journey example:**

```
1. Trigger: Customer books an appointment online
   ↓
2. Journey starts automatically
   ↓
3. WhatsApp node sends: "Hi {{first_name}}, your appointment at {{client_name}} is confirmed!"
   ↓
4. Customer receives: "Hi Sarah, your appointment at Downtown Clinic is confirmed!"
```

**The best part:** You set it up once, and it works for every customer automatically. No manual work needed!
