### Getting Started: Your 3-Step Setup

Setting up WhatsApp is straightforward. Follow these three simple steps and you'll be messaging customers in minutes.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Create your business account

Go to your inbox settings and click **"Connect to WhatsApp"**.

In the signup form, click **"Create a New Business Account"**.

Follow the prompts to set up your WhatsApp Business Account.

Complete the verification process (this usually takes a few minutes).

{% hint style="info" %}
**What to expect:** You'll need basic business information for verification. Have your business details handy to make this go smoothly.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Get your phone number

Once your business account is ready, you’ll need a WhatsApp phone number.

In your WhatsApp settings, click **"Purchase Number"**.

Search for available numbers in your region.

If none are available, purchase a US number instead.

Select your number and complete the purchase.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Pro tip:** If possible, choose a number that's easy to remember or matches your existing business phone number. This makes it easier for customers to recognize you.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Global messaging:** WhatsApp works globally, so a US number works perfectly for messaging customers anywhere in the world.
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Link your number to a location

After purchasing your number, click **"Setup Inbox"**.

Your number will be linked to that specific location.

Wait a moment for the setup to complete.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** Each location needs its own unique WhatsApp number. If you have multiple locations, purchase and set up a separate number for each one.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**You're done when:** You'll see a status indicator showing your WhatsApp inbox is "Active." Once you see that green status, you're ready to start messaging!
{% endhint %}
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Understanding WhatsApp Messaging: The Two Types

There are only two WhatsApp message types. Pick based on **time** and **intent**.

{% columns %}
{% column %}
#### Free-form messages (chat)

Use these when a customer is **already talking to you**.

* **When:** within **24 hours** of the customer’s last message
* **Approval:** none
* **Write:** anything (support, questions, back-and-forth)
* **Best for:** real conversations
{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}
#### Template messages (send-anytime)

Use these when you need to **reach out first**.

* **When:** **anytime**, even if it’s been weeks
* **Approval:** required (usually quick)
* **Write:** pre-approved wording with variables
* **Best for:** reminders, updates, campaigns, automation
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

#### The rule, in one picture

```
Customer last message
      │
      ├─ 0–24 hours → Free-form messages ✅
      │
      └─ After 24 hours → Template messages only ✅
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
After 24 hours, WhatsApp blocks free-form outreach. Use a template to restart.
{% endhint %}

#### Quick “which one do I use?” checklist

* Customer messaged you in the last 24 hours → **Free-form**
* Customer did not message recently → **Template**
* You want to automate this in Journeys → **Template**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Free-form example" %}
```
Customer: "Do you have availability today?"
You: "Yes. We have 3:30 PM or 5:00 PM. Which works?"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Template example" %}
```
Hi {{first_name}}, reminder: your appointment at {{client_name}} is tomorrow at 2:00 PM.
Reply 1 to confirm, 2 to reschedule.
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

<details>

<summary>What starts (or resets) the 24-hour window?</summary>

* The customer sends you a message.
* The customer replies to your template.
* The customer taps a button in an interactive message.

<details>

<summary>🎩 Best Practices</summary>

WhatsApp works best when it feels like a real chat. Keep messages short. Stay inside the 24-hour window whenever you can.

#### Messaging style that gets replies

1. Reply fast. Aim for under 1 hour in business hours.
2. Use free-form inside 24 hours.
3. Use templates after 24 hours.
4. Ask for one action per message.
5. Stop messaging when asked.

#### Messaging style that gets replies

* Start with context. Say why you’re writing.
* Put the key detail first. Time and location matter.
* Use line breaks. Avoid long paragraphs.
* End with a clear next step. Offer 2–3 options.
* Keep tone friendly. Skip corporate language.

```
Hi {{first_name}} — quick reminder for tomorrow.You’re booked at {{client_name}} at 2:00 PM.Reply 1 to confirm, 2 to reschedule.Hello valued customer. This message is to inform you that your scheduled appointment is approaching.Please review the details and confirm at your earliest convenience.
```

#### Template strategy

Use templates for proactive outreach and automation. Use free-form for support and back-and-forth.

* Keep templates for moments that matter. Reminders and confirmations.
* Write templates to handle replies. Confirm, reschedule, cancel.
* Test with a real number before going live.
* Track replies and drop-offs. Improve wording monthly.



See [WhatsApp Templates](whatsapp-templates.md) for approval tips.&#x20;

See [WhatsApp in Journeys](whatsapp-in-journeys.md) for automation patterns.

#### Timing and cadence

* Send operational messages in local time. Avoid late-night sends.
* For appointments, common timing is 24 hours and 2 hours before.
* For follow-ups, wait 1–2 days after the visit.
* For marketing, keep frequency low. Prioritize relevance over volume.

#### Response time (SLA)

| Response time    | What it signals                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Under 15 minutes | High-touch support                |
| Under 1 hour     | You’re on it                      |
| Same day         | Acceptable baseline               |
| Over 24 hours    | You’ll need a template to re-open |

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the customer’s last message was over 24 hours ago, you can’t send free-form outreach. Use a template to restart.
{% endhint %}

#### Compliance and account health

* Message only people who expect to hear from you.
* Keep marketing separate from transactional updates.
* Honor opt-outs immediately. Stop all future sends.
* Don’t “blast” the same copy to everyone. Personalize responsibly.
* Review rejected templates and resubmit with fixes.
