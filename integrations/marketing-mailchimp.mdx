# Mailchimp Integration in Kenko

What if your emails could greet every new lead, follow up with no-shows, remind about intro packs, and even say “thanks” after a sweaty HIIT class — without lifting a finger?

That’s what happens when you connect Kenko with Mailchimp. **Hands-off, highly personal email automation** that helps you build relationships while you focus on running your studio.

## Why Integrate Mailchimp?

Email is still king — especially when it’s timely, relevant, and well-targeted. With Mailchimp \+ Kenko, you can

- **Welcome new customers** with automations that feel personal.
- **Nurture leads** who haven’t booked (yet).
- **Keep members engaged** with newsletters and offers.
- **Collect feedback** after classes to improve your service.
- **Save hours** with automated workflows that run on autopilot.

## Best Practices for Next-Level Email Marketing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Talk Like a Human" icon="message">
    Nobody wants to read emails that sound like they came from a robot. Write your copy in a friendly, on-brand tone — just like you’d talk to someone at the front desk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Segment Like a Pro" icon="filter">
    Don’t send the same thing to everyone. Segment based on behavior: active members, trial users, no-shows, lapsed customers. Tailor your message for higher impact.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time Your Emails Strategically" icon="clock">
    Send onboarding emails right after sign-up, feedback requests right after a class, and re-engagement nudges _before_ someone disappears for good.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Merge Tags Wisely" icon="merge">
    Personalization goes a long way. Use merge tags like `*|FNAME|*` to say “Hey Jane” instead of “Dear User.” Add context like last class or membership type where possible.
  </Accordion>
