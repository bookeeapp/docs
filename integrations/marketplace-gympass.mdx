  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Client Tags" icon="users">
    When a Wellhub user books a class, they are automatically added to your Kenko CRM. You’ll see them as clients in your roster, and their profile will be tagged to indicate that they came via Wellhub.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Check-in Process" icon="user-clock">
    Wellhub clients must check in via the Wellhub mobile app before attending class. Always confirm that their check-in is complete before admitting them — it’s required for your studio to receive payment.

## Pricing Model

Wellhub uses a **pay-per-visit** model. You get paid every time a Wellhub user checks in to a class.

- Payments are determined based on your local market, studio type, and class category.
- There is no listing or setup fee.
- Kenko logs check-ins automatically, and Wellhub processes payments monthly.

This model ensures you only pay for results—actual attendance.
