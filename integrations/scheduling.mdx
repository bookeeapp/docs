## Best Practices for Scheduling Integrations

To get the most out of your scheduling integrations with Kenko, follow these best practices:

1. **Maintain a Single Source of Truth**: Make Kenko your primary scheduling tool to avoid conflicts
2. **Set Buffer Times**: Configure buffer times between appointments to account for transitions
3. **Test Virtual Sessions**: Always test your Zoom setup before hosting your first virtual class
4. **Use Descriptive Event Names**: Create clear, descriptive names for events that make sense across platforms
5. **Regularly Review Permissions**: Periodically check that your integration permissions are current

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your scheduling integrations, try these common solutions:

- **Sync Delays**: Allow up to 15 minutes for changes to propagate between systems
- **Missing Events**: Verify that the event categories are set to sync in your integration settings
- **Connection Issues**: Re-authorize the integration if you're experiencing persistent problems
- **Zoom Meeting Links Not Working**: Ensure your Zoom account is active and not at its meeting limit
