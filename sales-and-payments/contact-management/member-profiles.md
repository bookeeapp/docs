## How to add a customer to Kenko and Make updates to their profile

Understand all the ways a customer can be added to Kenko and how to manage customer data within the CRM

| **Method**                | **Description**                                                                 | **Studio Controlled?** |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Website or App Signup     | When a user signs up via the studio's public website or mobile app.             | No                     |
| Referral Signup           | When a new user signs up after being referred by an existing member.            | No                     |
| Related/Emergency Contact | When added as a related or emergency contact on another member’s profile.       | No                     |
| Buddy Pass                | When a user visits the studio as a guest via a Buddy Pass.                      | No                     |
| Embedded Form             | When someone fills out a form on the website that stores their info in the CRM. | No                     |
| Manual Entry              | Manually added by the studio team into the CRM.                                 | Yes                    |

Only \*\*Manual Entry\*\* is directly managed by studio owners or admins. All other additions are either automated or customer-initiated

### How to Add a new Member to CRM

Navigate to the "Add New" section on the side nav-bar from your dashboard.

```
![Screenshot2025 04 11at12 01 29PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-11at12.01.29PM.png)
```

The key distinction between adding a \*\*Lead\*\* and a \*\*Customer\*\* lies in membership status and follow-up responsibilities:

```
- **Lead**: A lead does _not_ require an active membership with the studio. However, to ensure proper follow-up, each lead must be assigned to a staff member for ongoing engagement.
- **Customer**: When a new customer is added to the platform, their profile is automatically routed to the Point of Sale (POS) interface. This prompts the studio administrator to proceed with the purchase of a membership on behalf of the customer.
```

Add the name, email, phone number and any other relevant details. You can also upload an image for them\\! Click Save to create the contact record in your CRM. Leads are users who haven’t yet booked or paid. Whereas, customers have active relationships through bookings, subscriptions, or purchases. Before creating a new user, always search for existing records to avoid duplication.

### Deleting a Customer from the CRM

In the Kenko platform, a Customer's profile can only be archived and not deleted.

Although there are some nuances related to archiving a Customer'a profile.

You should archive a \*\*Lead\*\* when

```
- They are **unresponsive** after multiple follow-ups.
- They have **explicitly declined** to join or engage further.
- Their information is **outdated** or incorrect.
- They’ve been **inactive** beyond your defined follow-up window (e.g. 30–60 days).

**Related Nuances**

- Archiving a lead stops any **automated follow-up workflows** or staff reminders.
- You may still retain them in your CRM for **retargeting or future reactivation**.
- Leads can be **restored or converted** to Customers later if needed.

   **_You cannot archive a Lead if any of the following are true_**

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Active Trial Pack Exists" icon="person-biking">
    - If a customer currently holds an **active Intro offer**, archiving is blocked.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pending Payment or Open Invoices" icon="file-invoice-dollar">
    - Leads with **unsettled dues**  must resolve their balances before being archived.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
<Card title="Ongoing Bookings or Scheduled Sessions" icon="sparkles">
  If the Lead is booked in any **upcoming classes, appointments, or events**, they cannot be archived.
</Card>
```

You should archive a \*\*Customer\*\* when

```
- Their **membership is canceled or expired**, and they no longer engage with the studio.
- They have **requested to be removed** or are **no longer part of your clientele**.
- You are performing **database hygiene** to clean up inactive accounts.

**Related Nuances**

- Archiving does **not delete** the customer's data — billing history, class attendance, and purchases remain intact for compliance and reporting.
- Archived customers cannot **log in**, **book classes**, or **receive notifications**.
- You can **reactivate** a customer anytime if they return to your studio

****_You cannot archive a customer if any of the following are true_****

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Active Membership Exists" icon="person-biking">
    - If a customer currently holds an **active membership or package**, archiving is blocked.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pending Payment or Open Invoices" icon="file-invoice-dollar">
    - Customers with **unsettled dues** or **outstanding invoices** must resolve their balances before being archived.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
<Card title="Ongoing Bookings or Scheduled Sessions" icon="sparkles">
  If the customer is booked in any **upcoming classes, appointments, or events**, they cannot be archived.
</Card>
```

## Quick actions on Contact's Profile

Change a customer's password to enable them to login. This feature can be used during emergencies when the customer is unable to change the password on their own.

```
<Warning>
  Ensure that customers change their passwords once they gain access to their account.

![Screenshot2025 04 09at12 44 54PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-09at12.44.54PM.png)

The edit profile section offers full flexibility in updating user information, ensuring accuracy across the system.
```

When same customer is using two different emails, Those profiles can be combined into one, ensuring that all data related to a contact is consolidated and streamlined.

```
This helps avoid confusion and duplicate records in the system, keeping your database clean and organized.

![Screenshot2025 04 09at12 47 48PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-09at12.47.48PM.png)
```

Archive a contact’s profile when they are no longer active, ensuring your database remains current without deleting valuable historical data.

```
Archived profiles can be restored later if needed, but they will no longer appear in the active contact list.

## Communication Methods with Contacts

There are multiple ways a particular studio can reach out to customers.

Journeys lets you build cohesive campaigns with all of Kenko's available channels. Automate and send personalized notifications across different touchpoints to engage customers. Create, manage, and track targeted marketing campaigns to promote your services or products. Manage and schedule appointments, classes, or events with ease using Kenko's integrated calendar. Communicate directly with your customers through private messaging for personalized support.

## Best Practices

Regularly review and update member information to ensure it remains current. Use consistent formats for phone numbers, addresses, and other data across all profiles. Only collect information you need and limit access to sensitive data. Encourage members to add profile photos to help staff provide personalized service.
