## Tips for an Optimal Kiosk Setup

Keep the Kiosk running on a stable tablet that stays mounted at your front desk. Use dummy check-ins to verify the pairing and display behavior. Make sure the Kenko Kiosk app is updated to the latest version from the App Store or Play Store. Avoid downtime by ensuring the tablet is always charged or powered.
