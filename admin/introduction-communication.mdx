# Communication Settings

Effective communication is the foundation of operational success in any fitness business. In Kenko, **Communication Settings** allow you to control how your studio interacts with leads, members, and staff—ensuring the right messages reach the right people at the right time.

Kenko’s communication system is designed to support **automated workflows**, **manual follow-ups**, and **broadcast messaging**, giving you the flexibility to manage marketing and operational conversations in one place.

## Why Communication Settings Matter

Without central control over messaging

- Important updates like class cancellations, payment reminders, or waivers may go unnoticed.
- Campaign performance is inconsistent due to fragmented outreach.
- Studio staff spend time chasing replies instead of focusing on customer experience.

Kenko solves these challenges by allowing you to **standardize channels, senders, and messaging rules** for different communication types.

## Core Use Cases

### 1. Inbox Routing & Notification

Kenko’s **Inbox** feature allows staff to directly engage with customers via SMS, WhatsApp, or email. Configuring communication settings ensures:

- Conversations are routed to the correct team member.
- Each location has a dedicated sender identity (email/SMS number).
- All messages remain centralized and tracked for accountability.

This is critical for responding to urgent messages like:

- “I’m running late for class—can I still attend?”
- “I need help rescheduling my session.”

Without proper configuration, these messages may be missed or duplicated, leading to poor customer experience.

### 2. Campaign Sender Management

Campaigns (like **intro offers**, **win-back flows**, or **seasonal promos**) are only as effective as their delivery. Communication settings allow you to:

- Set default email/SMS sender IDs for different campaigns.
- Ensure branding and domain alignment.
- Monitor deliverability and engagement rates.

For example, if you're sending out a **waiver reminder campaign**, configuring a recognizable sender ensures members open and act on it.

Misconfigured senders = ignored or blocked messages.

<Note>
  Communication Settings are **not optional**—they’re the backbone for ensuring messages from Kenko are **trusted, timely, and trackable**.
