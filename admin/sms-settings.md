## Configure numbers with Kenko

Kenko’s SMS Settings let you configure phone numbers, register with US carriers for compliance, and ensure reliable message delivery to your customers.

### Phone Number Configuration

Each Kenko location requires a unique phone number. This number is the sender for SMS campaigns, journeys, and inbox messages for that location.\ Using the same phone number for multiple locations will sync \*\*all contacts and messages to just one location\*\*, which may complicate communication management. Your phone number’s compliance status indicates if it’s registered and approved for sending SMS. Pending compliance means you need to complete US carrier registration before sending messages.

### US Carrier Registration

Kenko requires all virtual phone numbers sending SMS in the US to be A2P10DLC compliant. The registration process is handled via a wizard in Kenko’s SMS Settings.

Begin the wizard by providing your legal business name and tax ID to verify your business identity.

```

```

Enter your business type, registration numbers, and address. Accurate data here prevents application rejection.

Submit authorized representative and technical contact information. These contacts handle compliance and technical communications.

```

Confirm all information is correct and submit your registration for vetting by The Campaign Registry. Describe your typical SMS messages, campaigns, and opt-in processes. Providing clear, realistic examples improves approval chances.

```

```

Fees include a \`$4 brand registration\`, \`$15 manual vetting\`, and monthly \`$1.50 maintenance\`. Rejection incurs a \`$15 resubmission fee\`. Fees are billed to your credit card on file.

### What Happens After Submission?

The Campaign Registry reviews your submission for accuracy and compliance. You will be notified if your registration is approved or if additional data is needed. Keep your registration active by paying monthly fees and updating any changes in your business or messaging practices.

### International Considerations

Kenko currently requires US carrier compliance only. If you operate in other countries, please consult local regulations. Kenko will notify you if compliance requirements change.

### Best Practices for SMS Settings

Avoid sharing phone numbers across locations to ensure accurate contact syncing and message routing. During registration, provide all required business and messaging information thoroughly to avoid delays. Maintain records of customer consent to receive SMS to comply with laws and improve engagement. Regularly check your compliance status in Kenko and renew your registration when needed.
