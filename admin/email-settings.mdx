## Domain Authentication

Authentication verifies your domain to improve email deliverability and protect your emails from being marked as spam or spoofed.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a CNAME record?" icon="key-skeleton-left-right">
    A **CNAME (Canonical Name)** record is a DNS setting that links your domain or subdomain to another domain. In Kenko, CNAME records are used to prove ownership and enable tracking through trusted services like SendGrid.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is a TXT record and DMARC?" icon="gear">
    **TXT records** hold text-based information for your domain, including **DMARC** (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) policies.\
    DMARC helps prevent spoofing by specifying how mail servers should handle unauthenticated emails from your domain, improving your email's reputation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to verify your domain?" icon="check">
    1. Add the CNAME and TXT records provided by Kenko to your domain host's DNS settings.
    2. After propagation (which may take up to 48 hours), Kenko verifies these records automatically.
    3. Once verified, your domain status changes to **Verified**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Adding a new Domain" icon="plus">
    You can simple add a new Domain by clicking on "Add Domain" and add you business's domain which is used in your email-id.

## Email Forwarding

Kenko supports **email forwarding**, primarily configured for Gmail, to receive emails directly in your Kenko Inbox.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Why forward emails?">
    Forwarding routes emails sent to your business email address into Kenko’s Inbox, centralizing communication and making it easier for your team to respond from one platform.

    ![Screenshot2025 05 17at1 04 24AM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-17at1.04.24AM.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="How to set up forwarding (Gmail)?">
    1. In Gmail, go to **Settings \> Forwarding and POP/IMAP**.
    2. Click **Add a forwarding address** and enter the forwarding email provided by Kenko (e.g., [f77boxing-inbox7x@inbox.kenkomail.com](mailto:f77boxing-inbox7x@inbox.kenkomail.com)).
    3. Confirm the forwarding via the verification link sent to Kenko Inbox.
    4. Enable forwarding in Gmail.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Other email clients">
    Kenko also provides instructions to set up forwarding for other popular email providers to ensure smooth integration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Each email connected for forwarding must be unique per Kenko business location.\
  Using the same email for multiple locations will sync **all contacts and communications to just one location**, which may complicate management.
</Info>

## Sender Email Addresses

Managing sender emails helps maintain brand consistency and ensures replies are routed correctly.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are sender email addresses?" icon="arrow-down-right">
    These are the emails your studio uses to send messages from Kenko, such as newsletters, booking confirmations, or follow-ups.

    ![Screenshot2025 05 17at1 05 05AM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-17at1.05.05AM.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why keep sender emails unique per location?" icon="location-pin">
    Each location should have unique sender emails to avoid conflicts and ensure communications and replies are properly tracked for that location.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How to add and verify sender emails?" icon="check">
    - Use the **Add address** button to create a new sender email by entering the email prefix and display name.
    - Replies to these emails will appear in the Kenko AI Inbox.
    - Verify the email to ensure deliverability and reduce chances of your emails landing in spam.
