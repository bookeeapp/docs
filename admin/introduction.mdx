# Introduction to Admin Settings

Admin Settings in Kenko provide studio owners and managers with centralized control over staff roles, permissions, internal tasks, and communications.

This is where you define **who can do what**, how your **team operates day-to-day**, and how your studio stays in sync as it grows.

## What’s Included in Admin Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Roles & Privileges" icon="shield-check">
    Define staff access across Kenko. Use pre-set roles or build custom ones by toggling permissions per module.

    - Create roles like Admin, Sales Manager, Instructor, or Frontdesk
    - Control visibility for reports, CRM, scheduling, and billing
    - Ensure no unauthorized access to sensitive data
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Staff Accounts & Setup" icon="users">
    Add and manage staff across one or multiple locations:

    - Invite users via email
    - Assign them to services (e.g., Yoga, Massage)
    - Set availability and working hours
    - Link instructors to their class types and session formats
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Staff Attendance" icon="clock">
    Use Kenko’s built-in system to log staff check-ins and check-outs:

    - Monitor who’s present at each location
    - Generate attendance logs for payroll
    - Track shifts by IP/device
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Task Management" icon="diagram-subtask">
    Assign daily responsibilities and project-based tasks to team members:

    - Add tasks with deadlines and priority tags
    - Set recurrence (daily/weekly)
    - View completion status from the dashboard
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Communication Settings" icon="megaphone">
    Customize how staff are notified of key events:

    - New lead alerts
    - Schedule changes
    - Client replies or missed check-ins
    - Configure per user or role
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Role-Based Access for Franchises" icon="key">
    A franchise manager can access reports and schedules, but not billing. A frontdesk user only sees CRM and check-ins. Define this once under Roles & Privileges.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instructor Scheduling and Attendance" icon="calendar-check">
    Yoga teachers clock in when they arrive and check out after class. The studio manager views reports weekly for payroll.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Daily Frontdesk Checklists" icon="clipboard-list">
    Create recurring tasks for frontdesk staff: turn on music, check towels, verify bookings. Tasks reset daily.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Internal Notifications for Sales Leads" icon="bell">
    A new lead fills out a form → Sales Manager is notified via email \+ push → Task is auto-created to follow up.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Location Staff Management" icon="map">
    Assign instructors to different locations and configure their class visibility, time slots, and privileges accordingly.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
