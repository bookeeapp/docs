# Create Tasks for Studio Ops

Task Management in the system enables effective delegation, tracking, and completion of work-related activities by staff members. Tasks can be created, assigned, reminded, and tracked to ensure accountability and timely delivery.

## Creating a Task

To add a new task, users fill out the following fields

- **Task name**: Enter a descriptive name for the task.
- **For**: Specify the contact or person related to the task (optional).
- **Due date**: Select the deadline for the task to be completed.
- **Set Reminder**: Add a reminder notification for the due date.
- **Assigned to**: Choose the staff member responsible for completing the task.
- **Comment**: Provide additional details or instructions about the task.

## Task Filtering and Tabs

The task list can be filtered by

- **All**: Shows all tasks regardless of status.
- **Active**: Displays only tasks pending completion.
- **Completed**: Shows tasks that have been marked done.

These filters are accessible via tabs at the top of the task list for easy navigation.
