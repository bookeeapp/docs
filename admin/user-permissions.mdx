# User Permissions

Managing user access is essential for maintaining security and operational efficiency in your fitness business. Kenko's permission system allows you to control exactly what each team member can view and modify within the platform.

## Understanding User Roles

Kenko uses a role-based permission system to streamline access management:

## Managing User Accounts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access User Management">
    Navigate to **Admin Settings** > **User Management** > **Users**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View Existing Users">
    Review the list of current users with information about:
    - Name and contact information
    - Assigned role
    - Last login activity
    - Account status (active/inactive)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add New User">
    Click the **+ Add User** button to create a new user account:
    
    1. Enter basic information (name, email, phone)
    2. Set initial password or send setup email
    3. Assign a primary role
    4. Configure additional permissions (if needed)
    5. Set account expiration (optional)
    6. Click **Save** to create the account
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Edit Existing User">
    Modify a user's profile or permissions:
    
    1. Click on the user's name in the list
    2. Update information as needed
    3. Adjust permissions and access levels
    4. Save changes
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deactivate User">
    When a team member leaves:

    2. Click the **Actions** menu
    3. Select **Deactivate**
    4. Confirm the deactivation

    <Warning>
      Changes to a role affect all users assigned to that role. For individual exceptions, use custom permission sets instead.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Custom Role">
    Define a specialized role for your business:
    
    1. Click **+ Create Role**

| View Only | Can see information but not change it | Instructors can view but not edit the schedule |
| Limited Edit | Can make changes with restrictions | Front desk can update member profiles but not delete them |
| Full Access | Complete control over the feature | Managers can create and edit all class types |

## Location-Based Permissions

For businesses with multiple locations, you can restrict user access by location:

1. Navigate to **Admin Settings** > **User Management** > **Users**
2. Edit a user's profile
3. Scroll to **Location Access**
4. Choose from:
   - **All Locations**: User can access data for all business locations
   - **Selected Locations**: Choose specific locations the user can access
5. Save changes

<Warning>
  Location-based restrictions apply across all features. For example, if a user only has access to Location A, they won't see any data from Location B, including members, classes, or reports.
</Warning>
