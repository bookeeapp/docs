# Introduction to Products

Let’s face it — your business isn’t just about sessions and sweat. It’s also about community, lifestyle, and a great post-class smoothie. That’s where **Products** in Kenko come in.

From protein bars to branded hoodies, Kenko’s product system lets you sell, track, and manage your physical inventory — all within the platform.

## Why Should You Sell Products?

Because people want more than just a workout. They want a vibe. A lifestyle. And yes, a branded water bottle that says “I don’t skip leg day.”

Here’s why studios love offering products

- **Boost Revenue**: You already have traffic — products help you monetize it.
- **Stay Top of Mind**: Every branded tote bag becomes a walking ad.
- **Upsell Opportunities**: Sell accessories, drinks, and gear at checkout.
- **Inventory Made Easy**: Kenko helps you manage stock, pricing, and receipts in one place.

> Think of it like this: your clients already love what you do. Now give them something to take home with them.

## What Can Studios Sell?

Honestly? A lot. Here are some common categories

| **Category**        | **Examples**                                  |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Apparel             | T-shirts, leggings, hoodies, socks            |
| Accessories         | Water bottles, yoga mats, resistance bands    |
| Consumables         | Energy bars, protein shakes, hydration drinks |

| Essentials          | Toiletries, deodorant, dry shampoo            |

If you can stock it at your front desk or sell it on your app, it’s a product.
