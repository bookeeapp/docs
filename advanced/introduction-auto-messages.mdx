# Auto-Messages ( Notifications ) in Kenko

Auto-Messages (also known as Notifications) are Kenko’s built-in automated messaging system — designed to keep your clients informed, engaged, and showing up. Whether it's a class reminder, a welcome email, or a follow-up after a session, these messages go out automatically based on user behavior and schedule triggers.

No manual typing. No missed reminders. Just consistent, timely communication.

## Why Auto-Messages Matter

Staying connected with clients is key to building relationships, reducing no-shows, and driving long-term retention. Auto-Messages handle this communication at scale, helping your team focus on what they do best — delivering great experiences.

- **Fewer No-Shows**: Reminders reduce missed bookings and increase attendance rates.
- **Stronger Brand Experience**: Polished, on-brand messages make your studio feel personal and reliable.
- **Higher Conversion**: Smart follow-ups turn trials into members, and drop-offs into reactivations.
- **Time Saved**: Let automation handle the repetition so your team doesn’t have to.
