  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Add Product' or Edit Existing">
    Click **Add Product** to create something new.\
    Or hit **Edit** to update an existing product.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Basic Product Details">
    Add a **Title**, optional **Brand**, and a brief **Description**.\
    The status can be **Draft** (invisible) or **Active** (available for sale).

    > To add a new brand, just start typing in the **Brand** field. Kenko auto-creates it and adds it to your global brand list.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Variants if Needed">
    If your product has variations (like size or color), enable **This product has multiple options**.

    ![Screenshot2025 05 14at12 13 04PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-14at12.13.04PM.png)

    Then enter values like

    - Size → S, M, L, XL
    - Color → Black, Blue, Green
    - Material → Cotton, Synthetic

    ![Screenshot2025 05 14at12 14 04PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-14at12.14.04PM.png)

    Kenko will auto-generate all combinations for setup.

    ![Screenshot2025 05 14at12 14 16PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-14at12.14.16PM.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Each Variant">
    For each variant

    - Add **Price** and optional **Compare at price**
    - Upload **Product images**
    - Define a **SKU** for inventory tracking
    - Check “Charge tax” if applicable

    ![Screenshot2025 05 14at12 17 02PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-14at12.17.02PM.png)

    > **What’s a SKU?**\
    > SKU stands for Stock Keeping Unit — a unique identifier like `TSHIRT-BLU-M`.\
    > It helps you track stock, reorder efficiently, and avoid mix-ups.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Location-Based Inventory">
    Add available quantities for each **studio location** you operate in.\
    If the product isn't available somewhere, just leave the quantity at zero.

    > Products are only shown at POS or app **in the locations where stock exists.**

    ![Screenshot2025 05 14at12 17 11PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-14at12.17.11PM.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save & Activate">
    Click **Save Changes** to finalize the product.\
    If marked active and stock is available, it will be ready for purchase at checkout or via the mobile app.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Do Customers Receive Products?

All products are set up for **physical pickup only**. Once a customer purchases through POS or the app

- The product is marked as “purchased”
- The front desk or staff hands it over in-studio
- Inventory automatically updates based on the pickup location

There is no home delivery or courier support built into Kenko at this time.

## Product Fulfillment

Once products are sold and received by the Customer, they have to be marked as "Fulfilled" for tracking and report management.

To fulfill an order, Navigate to Contact `Profile -> Payments`. When a Product is purchased, Mark as fulfilled options pops-up.

## **Best Practices**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always Add Product Images" icon="image">
    A product with no image is easy to skip. Use tools like **PicCopilot** or **GPT-powered generation** to create clean, on-brand mockups fast.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Standardize SKU Formats" icon="barcode">
    Use a consistent format like `TOP-BLK-S` for t-shirts or `YOGA-GRN-L` for gear. This makes inventory reporting and troubleshooting easier later.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Clear Variant Labels" icon="badge-check">
    Stick to conventional values like S/M/L and primary color names. Avoid complex abbreviations that confuse customers or staff.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Track Low Stock Weekly" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Visit the inventory screen regularly to restock top sellers and archive out-of-stock variants if needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assign Inventory by Location" icon="map">
    Always double-check that you've entered quantities by location. Otherwise, a product won't appear at POS or app for those customers.
