  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize Your Banner Text">
    Use the banner text section to describe your referral offer.\
    This message appears to customers on your website and mobile app.

    **Example**\
    `Refer and give your friend 15% off a 2-week pass! ðŸŽ‰ After they attend 4 classes, you get a FREE 5-class pack (valid 30 days)! ðŸ’ª`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set New Customer Offer">
    Choose what your referred customer gets

    - **Memberships/Packs:** Give them access to a specific service or class pack.
    - **Discount Code:** Apply a percentage or flat discount.

    You can configure this per region/location if needed.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Referral Message">
    Set the default message that gets sent when a referral link is shared.\
    You can use smart tags like `{referral_code}`, `{referred_by_first_name}`, and `{business_name}`.

    **Example Message**\
    `Your friend has invited you to join {business_name}. Avail your referral offer by signing up on our mobile app. Use my referral code {referral_code} while signing up.`

    Decide what the referring customer receives once their referral is successful.

    **Choose a trigger**

    - Referral becomes valid after **X classes/appointments are attended** by the new user.

    **Choose a reward type**

    - Memberships/packs
    - Discount code

## Best Practices for a High-Performing Referral Program

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep the Offer Simple and Clear" icon="bolt">
    Avoid complicated rules. Stick to one-line rewards that are easy to explain and remember. If a client can repeat it, theyâ€™ll share it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Make the Reward Win-Win" icon="handshake">
    Give both the referrer and the new client something valuable. This doubles the incentive to participate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Friendly, Personal Messaging" icon="message">
    Let your members use their voice with customizable messages. Encourage emojis and fun tone â€” it performs better.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Donâ€™t Wait Too Long to Reward" icon="timer">
    Set a realistic trigger (like 1â€“2 visits attended) so rewards feel attainable and donâ€™t delay gratification.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Promote It Everywhere" icon="megaphone">
    Add banners to your homepage, post on Instagram, and remind clients in class. If they donâ€™t know about it, they wonâ€™t use it.
