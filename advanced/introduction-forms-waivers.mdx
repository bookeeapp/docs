# Forms & Agreements

Forms aren’t just boring paperwork anymore. In Kenko, they’re the gatekeepers of safety, consent, and smooth onboarding — and they’re 100% digital.

Whether it's a waiver before a high-intensity class, a COVID declaration, or a medical disclosure for physiotherapy — Kenko’s **Forms & Agreements** feature helps you get the right acknowledgment at the right time.

## Why Every Studio Needs Forms & Agreements

Whether you run a yoga studio, a fitness franchise, or a wellness clinic — having proper agreements in place is **not optional**. Here's why:

- **Minimize Legal Risk**\
  If something goes wrong (like an injury or a missed policy), your signed waiver is your first line of defense.
- **Set Expectations Clearly**\
  Let clients know what’s allowed, what’s not, and what to expect — before any confusion or conflict arises.
- **Build Trust with Clients**\
  When people know you take safety and transparency seriously, they’re more likely to stick around.
- **Stay Compliant with Insurance and Local Laws**\
  Many insurers and jurisdictions require documented consent or signed waivers before services begin.
