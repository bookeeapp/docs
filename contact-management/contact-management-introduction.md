## Leads vs. Customers

Understanding the difference between **Leads** and **Customers** helps you optimize your efforts in nurturing and managing each contact type

Leads are prospects in the \*\*introductory offer\*\* or \*\*trial membership\*\* phase. They have not yet made a purchase, and your goal is to convert them into paying customers through follow-ups and marketing campaigns. Customers have \*\*active memberships\*\* or \*\*bookings\*\*. They have made a purchase, signed up for memberships, or booked sessions. They are fully integrated into your business's operations.

### Key Differences

**Leads**: Primarily for individuals who are in the trial phase or interested in the intro offer.
