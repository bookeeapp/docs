| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------- |

| Referral Signup           | When a new user signs up after being referred by an existing member.            | No                     |
| Related/Emergency Contact | When added as a related or emergency contact on another member’s profile.       | No                     |
| Buddy Pass                | When a user visits the studio as a guest via a Buddy Pass.                      | No                     |

</Info>

### How to Add a new Member to CRM

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Contacts in CRM">
    Navigate to the "Add New" section  on the side nav-bar from your dashboard.

    ![Screenshot2025 04 11at12 01 29PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-04-11at12.01.29PM.png)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select whether you are adding a Lead or a Customer">
    The key distinction between adding a **Lead** and a **Customer** lies in membership status and follow-up responsibilities:

    - **Lead**: A lead does _not_ require an active membership with the studio. However, to ensure proper follow-up, each lead must be assigned to a staff member for ongoing engagement.
    - **Customer**: When a new customer is added to the platform, their profile is automatically routed to the Point of Sale (POS) interface. This prompts the studio administrator to proceed with the purchase of a membership on behalf of the customer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in Details">
    Add the name, email, phone number and any other relevant details. You can also upload an image for them\!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save the Profile">
    Click Save to create the contact record in your CRM.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Leads are users who haven’t yet booked or paid. Whereas, customers have active relationships through bookings, subscriptions, or purchases.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Before creating a new user, always search for existing records to avoid duplication.
</Warning>

### Deleting a Customer from the CRM

In the Kenko platform, a Customer's profile can only be archived and not deleted.

Although there are some nuances related to archiving a Customer'a profile.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When to Archive a Lead" icon="sparkles">
    You should archive a **Lead** when

    - They are **unresponsive** after multiple follow-ups.
    - They have **explicitly declined** to join or engage further.
    - Their information is **outdated** or incorrect.
    - They’ve been **inactive** beyond your defined follow-up window (e.g. 30–60 days).

    **Related Nuances**

    - Archiving a lead stops any **automated follow-up workflows** or staff reminders.
    - You may still retain them in your CRM for **retargeting or future reactivation**.
    - Leads can be **restored or converted** to Customers later if needed.

       **_You cannot archive a Lead if any of the following are true_**

    <CardGroup cols="2">

    - You can **reactivate** a customer anytime if they return to your studio
