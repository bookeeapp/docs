# Billing & Payments

Kenko's billing system covers pricing, subscriptions, invoices, and in-person sales.

It's connected to your CRM, so every order updates the member profile automatically.

## What you manage here

* Sell memberships and packs (subscriptions, credit packs, intro offers, top-ups).
* Control how people pay (card, cash, custom payment modes, pay-later rules).
* Configure taxes and invoice requirements.
* Run POS sales for walk-ins and front desk transactions.
* Track payments per contact, including history and refunds.
* Pay staff using payroll templates (if enabled).

## Core building blocks

### Membership products

* **Subscriptions**: recurring revenue.
* **Credit packs**: pay-as-you-go credits.
* **Intro packs**: first-time offers to convert leads.
* **Top-ups**: keep a member balance for flexible spending.

### Checkout and accounting essentials

* **Taxes**: calculated automatically based on your configuration.
* **Invoices**: generated from orders and used for accounting.
* **Receipts**: sent to members for clarity.

Note: Tax and invoicing rules vary by country. Configure these with your accountant's guidance.

## Typical setup flow

1. Configure payment methods and invoice settings.
2. Create memberships and pricing.
3. Set up taxes, then run a test checkout.
4. Train your team on POS basics (sales, refunds, payment modes).

## CRM Billing Integration

Billing is tied to the contact profile, so your team always has the full context.

Use this to:

* See memberships, credits, invoices, and payment history in one place.
* Take payments, issue refunds, and resend receipts as needed.
* Run recurring billing for subscriptions and automated renewals.
* Let members buy packs and top-ups from the website/app, with the same history.

## Operational tips

* Keep pricing simple. Fewer products means fewer mistakes.
* Use intro offers with clear limits (time, visits, or purchase count).
* Review failed payments and outstanding dues weekly.
* Restrict pay-later options to trusted members.
* Audit refunds monthly to keep reporting accurate.
