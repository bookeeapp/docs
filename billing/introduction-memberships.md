# Introduction Memberships

Kenko's **Memberships** feature is designed to provide fitness studios with flexible, automated, and client-friendly solutions. Whether you're offering recurring memberships, credit-based packs, or introductory offers, Kenko ensures a seamless experience for both clients and administrators.

## Membership Types

Kenko supports various membership models to cater to different client needs. You can choose the best option based on the services you offer.

Offer daily, weekly, or monthly memberships with automated billing cycles. Ideal for clients who need ongoing access to your services. Clients purchase packs of credits that can be used for classes or appointments. You can set up auto-renewal and rollover of unused credits for maximum flexibility. Provide new clients with discounted or trial memberships, often with auto-expiration to encourage prompt usage and quick conversion to full memberships.

## Key Features

Kenko's membership system offers several advanced features to improve the client experience and streamline your studio's operations:

Credit packs can now start on the date the customer attends their first class, providing flexibility and clarity. This ensures that clients can start using their credits immediately without worrying about when their membership officially begins. Clients can book classes using upcoming memberships, allowing them to schedule sessions before the membership's official start date. This feature makes it easier for clients to plan their visits. Memberships and credit packs can be set to auto-renew when credits are exhausted, and unused credits can be rolled over to the next period. This ensures clients don't lose any value from unused credits and provides a smoother renewal process. Kenko allows you to set up different \*\*pricing categories\*\* to cater to various client segments. You can create pricing tiers for:

```
- **Individual Memberships**: Offer clients single-use or one-off memberships.
- **Family Memberships**: Provide group-based memberships at a discounted rate for families.
- **Corporate Memberships**: Special pricing for employees or groups from partnering companies.
  This flexibility allows you to target specific demographics with tailored pricing models.
```

Memberships can be bundled with various benefits that encourage clients to sign up and stay longer. Some examples include:

```
- **Exclusive Access to Special Classes**: Members get access to special, members-only classes or events.
- **Discounted Services**: Provide discounts for services like personal training, massage, or special workshops.
- **Priority Booking**: Members can book classes before non-members, giving them priority for high-demand sessions.
- **Access to Additional Facilities**: Memberships may grant access to premium facilities such as VIP rooms, additional equipment, or special amenities.
```

## CRM Integration

Kenko's CRM integration enhances the membership experience. You can maintain client profiles, set up automated renewal reminders, and track usage patterns.

Keep detailed records of each client's membership status, payment history, and usage patterns. This makes it easier to track client engagement and identify opportunities for upselling or re-engagement. Set up automated renewal reminders and processes to ensure continuous membership without manual intervention. Clients will receive notifications before their memberships expire, encouraging them to renew on time. Configure alerts for upcoming renewals, expiring credits, or inactivity. Proactively notify clients about key membership milestones, ensuring they remain engaged with your services.

## What Can Be Accessed by Memberships?

Memberships provide different levels of access to various services within Kenko. This can include:

Members can access specific classes depending on their membership tier. For example, a basic membership might grant access to regular classes, while a premium membership could unlock premium or specialized classes. Members may be allowed to book appointments (such as personal training or massage sessions) at discounted rates or as part of their membership package. Some memberships offer exclusive access to special events, workshops, or seminars that are only available to members, providing added value and fostering a sense of community. Depending on the membership type, clients may have access to specific facilities, such as a VIP room, equipment, or areas within the gym or studio that are not accessible to non-members.

## Best Practices for Membership Management

Regularly evaluate your membership offerings to ensure they are competitive and meet the needs of your clientele. Adapt pricing and benefits as necessary based on market demand and customer feedback. Providing flexible payment plans (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annual payments) makes it easier for clients to commit to longer memberships while ensuring steady revenue for the business. Clearly communicate the benefits that come with each membership tier. Transparency fosters trust and helps clients understand the value they’re getting from their membership. Use introductory offers to attract new clients, offering them a low-risk way to experience your services. Once they see the value of your services, they’re more likely to convert to full memberships.
