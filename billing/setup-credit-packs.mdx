# Deep Dive into Credit Packs

Credit Packs are one-time credit bundles that provide access to services like classes or appointments. Unlike Subscriptions, they do not renew automatically and are ideal for customers seeking flexibility without a recurring commitment.

## Creating a Credit Pack Membership

You can create a Credit Pack membership in Kenko by:

<Note>
  Navigating to Sidebar \> Setup \> Pricing Options \> Create new
</Note>

You can also create a Group of Pricing options for better accessibility of Pricing options which can be grouped together.

Setting up Credit Pack memberships in Kenko involves three main steps: defining **Basic Details**, setting **Expiry and Credits**, and configuring **Pricing Options**. In this guide, weâ€™ll go through each step with an explanation of every detail.

## Basic Details

The first step is to define the **basic details** of your credit pack plan. Here you will set the membership type, location, and related metadata.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Membership Type" icon="rotate">
    You can choose from different membership types:

    - **Subscription**: A recurring plan that automatically renews.
    - **Credit Pack**: One-time credit packs that can be used for classes or appointments.
    - **Top-Up Pack**: Add more credits to existing memberships.

    <Note>
      This setup guide is for Credit Packs, which are one-time purchases.

      alt="Membership Type"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Location & Plan Name" icon="location-pin">
    - **Location**: Select the location where the credit pack can be purchased (e.g., a specific branch).
    - **Plan Name**: Set a descriptive name for the plan. It will appear to customers as they choose their membership.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-22at5.55.25PM.png"
      alt="Location & Plan Name"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Membership Group & Description" icon="icons">
    Choose a Group for the Membership for easier access and add a description for your customers so that they can make an informed decision.

    <Note>
      You should add all the perks that come bundled with the Credit Pack for better visibility.
    </Note>
    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-22at5.57.02PM.png"
      alt="Membership Group & Description"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Expiry and Credits

In this step, you'll define the credit pack's expiry and any credits associated with the membership. This section includes setting the validity period and any restrictions regarding the credit pack.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Validity Period " icon="calendar">
    - **Validity Period**: Set the duration for which the credit pack is valid (e.g., "Valid for 6 months from purchase").

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at2.38.23PM.png"
      alt="Validity Period & Expiry"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Booking Credits" icon="coins">
    You can define if you want to include Booking credits with a credit pack or not. You should consider the following scenarios to decide whether or not to enable it.

    **Toggle ON**: Use when offering credit packs that include access to classes or appointments as part of the plan, simplifying bookings for your customers.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-22at6.03.44PM.png"
      alt="Booking Credits Toggle On"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    **Toggle OFF**: Use when you want to offer credit packs without automatic class/appointment access, requiring customers to purchase credits separately for each booking.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-22at6.04.23PM.png"
      alt="Booking Credits Toggle Off"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    If enabled, it is mandatory to choose a service the credit pack is applicable to. The service can either be classes, appointments, or both.

    You can furthermore customize it for selected classes or appointments and whether or not customers can book unlimited sessions or session bookings should have a limit to it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credit Limit" icon="coin-vertical">
    A credit pack can have both Limited and Unlimited Credits, implying that each credit pack provides a set number of credits or unlimited credits as defined by the pack.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-22at6.10.19PM.png"
      alt="Credit Limit"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Trial Membership" icon="tag">
    A credit pack can also be turned into a Trial Membership which is a special type of offering for new customers for a business.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="(/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at3.50.40PM.png"
      alt="Price Setup"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pricing

Now, set the pricing for the credit pack, define any applicable taxes, and set minimum purchase requirements.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Price Setup" icon="dollar-sign">
    **Price**: Enter the price for the credit pack. The price can be set as a one-time payment.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at3.53.56PM.png"
      alt="Price Setup"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Payment Plan" icon="coins">
    Payment Plans allow customers to pay in installments instead of the full amount upfront. 

    _e.g. - A $100 plan with a $10 initial payment and two monthly installments of $45 each. _

    This feature enhances payment flexibility and improves conversion for high-ticket offerings.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at3.55.55PM.png"
      alt="Price Setup"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
