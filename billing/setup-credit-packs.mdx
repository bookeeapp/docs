</Note>

You can also create a Group of Pricing options for better accessibility of Pricing options which can be grouped together.

Setting up subscription memberships in Kenko involves three main steps: defining **Basic Details**, setting **Expiry and Credits**, and configuring **Pricing Options**. In this guide, weâ€™ll go through each step with an explanation of every detail.

## Basic Details

The first step is to define the **basic details** of your subscription plan. Here you will set the membership type, location, and related metadata.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Membership Type" icon="rotate">
    You can choose from different membership types:

    - **Subscription**: A recurring plan that automatically renews.
    - **Credit Pack**: One-time credit packs that can be used for classes or appointments.
    - **Top-Up Pack**: Add more credits to existing memberships.

    <Note>
      This setup guide is for Subscriptions which are recurring in nature.

    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Location & Plan Name" icon="location-pin">
    - **Location**: Select the location where the subscription can be purchased (e.g., a specific branch).
    - **Plan Name**: Set a descriptive name for the plan. It will appear to customers as they choose their membership.

    />

    />

</AccordionGroup>

## Expiry and Credits

In this step, you'll define the subscription's expiry and any credits associated with the membership. This section includes setting the renewal period and any restrictions regarding the subscription.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Renewal Period & Maximum Cycles" icon="calendar">
    - **Renewal Period**: Set the period/Cycle for renewal, such as "Every 1 month". This is post which the credit balance gets reset to the original quantity ensuring customers keep enjoying the Subscription's benefits.
    - **Maximum Cycles**: Define the maximum number of cycles a membership can go through before it expires. i.e if you set "12 cycle" the Membership expires after that unless renewed otherwise.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-22at5.59.09PM.png"
      alt="Renewal Period & Maximum Cycles"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credit Roll-over & Expiry" icon="credit-card">
    - **Credit Roll-over**: Enable the option to carry over unused credits to the next cycle.
    - **Expiry**: Set expiry for credits or memberships if they are not renewed within a specified time.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">

      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-22at5.59.09PM.png"
      alt="Credit Roll-over & Expiry"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Booking Credits" icon="coins">
    You can define if you want to include Booking credits with a subscription or not. You should consider the following scenarios to decide whether or not to enable it.

    **Toggle ON**: Use when offering memberships that include access to classes or appointments or both as part of the plan, simplifying bookings for your members.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-22at6.03.44PM.png"
      alt="Booking Credits Toggle On"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    **Toggle OFF**: Use when you want to offer memberships without automatic class/appointment access, requiring customers to purchase credits separately for each booking.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-22at6.04.23PM.png"
      alt="Booking Credits Toggle Off"
      className="max-w-[500px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    If enabled, It is mandatory to choose a service the membership is applicable to. The service can either be classes, appointments, or both.

    You can furthermore customize it for selected classes or appointments and whether or not customers can book unlimited sessions or session bookings should have a limit to it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Credit Limit" icon="coin-vertical">
    A subscription can have both Limited and Unlimited Credits, this implies that each cycle the customer will receive Unlimited credits or a set number of credits as defined by the subscription.
