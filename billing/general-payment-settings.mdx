# General Payment Settings in Kenko

Kenko offers flexible and powerful payment configuration tools to manage customer transactions efficiently. This guide walks you through how to customize payment modes, set retry and cancellation logic, configure enrollment fees, and control trial pack limits.

## Payment Modes

You can select the methods through which payments will be accepted at your studio.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Available Payment Modes" icon="credit-card">
    - **Credit/Debit Card (External) **( Default )
    - **Cash **(Default)

    The sole purpose of adding payment methods here is to mark any sale made from POS against the used payment method.

    This helps in keeping track of the payments in a more structured manner.

    You can enable or disable any method remove custom ones.
