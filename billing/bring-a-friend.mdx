  </Step>
</Steps>

## Subscription Setup for Bring a Friend

### Subscriptions

#### i) Limited Credits

For limited credit subscriptions, you can either allow free purchases or charge for each friend brought, with credits being deducted based on the class or appointment.

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-23at12.52.27PM.png"
  alt="Limited Credits"
  className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>

#### ii) Unlimited Credits

For unlimited credit subscriptions, **only free pricing** is allowed, as credit-based deductions do not apply here.

<Tip>
  The "Bring a Friend" feature resets every subscription renewal cycle. For example, if a customer has 2 unused buddy passes from a previous month, they will start with 4 passes in the next cycle.
</Tip>

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">

  alt="Unlimited Credits"
  className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>

### Credit Packs

The conditions for **Limited Credit Packs** and **Unlimited Credit Packs** are similar to subscriptions, with one key difference: for Credit Packs, the quota for buddy passes lasts until the **Credit Pack's expiry**.

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">

</div>

## How Does it Appear for Your Customers?

Once customers have access to the **Bring a Friend** feature, they will be able to invite friends when booking a class or appointment.

### Website Widget View

Customers will see a prompt indicating whether they can bring a friend based on their purchased pricing option.

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-03-06at1.22.39PM.png"
  alt="Website Widget View"
  className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>

After choosing to bring a friend, customers will need to enter the friend's details, which will be saved in the CRM as a lead.

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-20at1.26.27PM.png"
  alt="Enter Friend's Details"
  className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>

<Tip>
  It’s a good idea to mention "Bring a Friend" in the description of the Pricing option for better visibility to customers.
</Tip>

## Customer App View

The **Bring a Friend** feature also works in the Customer App. Customers can invite their friends while booking a session. The process is similar to the website widget experience.

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-20at6.42.12PM-2.png"
  alt="Customer App View"
  className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>

## Important Notes

- **Friend's Details Saved in CRM**: When customers add their friends, the friend's details will be saved in the CRM as a lead.
- **No Email Check**: Currently, we do not check whether the friend's email already exists in our CRM, so a friend can be added multiple times.

### Post-Booking Process

Once the booking is confirmed, both the customer and their friend will receive a booking confirmation with their assigned spots. They will be able to view their upcoming bookings under **Account \> Upcoming Bookings**.

<Note>
  **Note**: Customers can also book a class or appointment through the **Customer App** along with their friends joining them using the **Buddy Passes**.
</Note>

## Bring a Friend and Spot Booking

Customers can book a spot for themselves and their friends in their favorite classes based on the membership they have purchased. The **Bring a Friend** feature extends to spot booking, allowing customers to book a place for both themselves and their friend(s) for a class or appointment.

### Key Points

**Spot Booking for Friends**: Customers can use their **Bring a Friend** passes to book a spot for their friends in the class or appointment.

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img

  alt="Spot Booking for Friends"
  className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>

- **Enter Friend's Details**: The main customer has to enter the details of the friend they wish to bring. Once the friend’s details are entered, the **facility layout** will open for spot selection.

  <Note>
    The main customer can only access this benefit if their membership plan allows **Bring a Friend**.
  </Note>

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot+2025-02-28+at+4_49_30%E2%80%AFPM.png"
  alt="Enter Friend's Details for Spot Booking"
  className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>

- **Choose Spot for Themselves and Friends**: After entering the details, the customer will be able to choose spots for both themselves and their friend(s) in the class.

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot+2025-02-28+at+4_52_23%E2%80%AFPM.png"
  alt="Choose Spots"
  className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>

- **Confirmation**: After the booking is confirmed, both the main customer and their friend will receive a booking confirmation email with their assigned spots for the class.

<Warning>
  This feature is only available if the **Bring a Friend** option is part of the purchased membership. Ensure that the customer has a valid membership that supports this feature to be able to bring a friend and book spots.
</Warning>

## Cancellation of Bookings Using Bring a Friend

### Canceling the Booking

If a customer cancels their own booking, their friend's booking will also be canceled. Friends cannot attend without the main customer who has purchased the membership and booked the session.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Late Cancellation with a Limited Credit Plan" icon="calendar-xmark">
    - **Fee Charged**: If a fee is charged, the customer holding the membership will pay the cancellation fee for all non-attendees.
    - **Credits Charged**: Credits will be deducted for the customer and their friends from the membership.
    - **Both Fee and Credits Charged**: The customer will incur a fee and credits will be deducted for both the customer and their friends.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Late Cancellation with Unlimited Credit Plan" icon="infinity">
    - The customer holding the membership is the only one charged the cancellation fee.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Free Cancellations" icon="calendar-check">
    - No charges will apply to anyone if the cancellation is free.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## No-Show Charges for Bring a Friend Bookings

No-show charges are similar to cancellation charges for **Bring a Friend** bookings:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When Credit is Deducted as No-Show Fee" icon="coin">
    - Credits will be deducted from the main customer's account for all non-attendees.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When Monetary Fee is Deducted as No-Show Fee" icon="money-bill-wave">
    - The main customer will pay the no-show fee for all non-attendees. No-show fees will be charged immediately if a card is saved, or as an amount due if no card is saved.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  If a friend decides not to attend but the main customer attends, the no-show fee will only be charged for the friend, and only if credits are used.
</Note>

## Feature Availability and Scope

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For Bookings">
    - The **Bring a Friend** option is available for **Classes** and **Appointments**.
    - The feature will only be visible to customers if their membership allows it.
    - Customers can access this feature through both the **website widget** and the **customer app**.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="For Setup">
    - **Bring a Friend** can only be set up through the **Pricing Options** in the CRM.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Booking Constraints and Limitations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quick Pay & Bring a Friend" icon="credit-card">
    - **Bring a Friend** cannot be used with **Quick Pay** because it is tied to a membership.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Free Classes/Appointments" icon="star">
    - **Bring a Friend** does not apply to free classes or appointments since no membership is required for booking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-Credit Sessions" icon="coins">
    - **Bring a Friend** cannot be used for sessions that require multiple credits. This is a future enhancement we are considering.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple Plans & Bring a Friend" icon="users">
    - To use **Bring a Friend**, all credits must come from a single pricing option. Combining multiple plans for a booking is not supported.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Book for Someone Else & Bring a Friend" icon="user-plus">
    - **Book for Someone Else** cannot be used in combination with **Bring a Friend**. The latter relies on the customer's own membership, while the former uses the plan of the person being booked.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
