## Trial Pack Usage Settings

Trial Packs can be used to attract new customers by offering discounted or free services. However, to avoid misuse, it is essential to set restrictions on how many Trial Packs a customer can purchase.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Trial Pack Purchase Limit" icon="credit-card">
    To set up the purchase limit for Trial Packs, navigate to **Settings** \> **Payments** \> **General**. Under **Global Trial Pack Settings**, define the number of Trial Packs that can be purchased within a set time period.

    <Note>
      Default: "Members can purchase 1 Trial Pack in 1 year per Business."
    </Note>
    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-03-05at3.47.52PM.png"
      alt="Trial Pack Purchase Limit"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Customizing Trial Pack Usage

There are several customizable options for Trial Packs, including duration, purchase limits, and levels of application.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Duration" icon="clock">
    Set how many months or years the purchase limit of the Trial Pack should apply. The maximum limit is 30 months/years.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-03-05at4.38.22PM.png"
      alt="Trial Pack Duration"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Purchase Levels" icon="stairs">
    Customize how Trial Packs can be purchased by setting the purchase limit at different levels. Below are the options

    **Business Level**: If set to Business level, the setting applies to all Trial packs across all regions and locations in the business.

    Example: If the setting is “Members can purchase 2 Trial Packs in 1 month per Business,” then customers can only purchase a total of 2 Trial packs at any location across all regions in one month.

    **Region Level**: If set to Regional level, the setting applies to all locations within a specific region.

    Example: If the setting is “Members can purchase 2 Trial Packs in 1 month per Region,” customers can purchase a total of 2 Trial packs across all locations within the same region in one month. Total purchases possible = Total regions x 2.

    **Location Level**: If set to Location level, the setting applies to individual locations.

    Example: If the setting is “Members can purchase 2 Trial Packs in 1 month per Location,” customers can only purchase a total of 2 Trial packs at one location in a month. Total purchases possible = Total locations x 2.

    <Note>
      When configuring the settings, consider the business structure, and how widespread the limits should be across regions and locations.
    </Note>

    />

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Example Reference Table

Consider a business with two regions and multiple locations. If each setting allows a maximum of 3 Trial Packs per month, here’s how the limits work:

| Limit Type     | Allowed Purchases | Where Can They Purchase?        | Not Allowed Purchases               | Total Purchases Possible |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 3 per Location | 3 per location    | Any location (L1-L6)            | 4 or more at any single location    | 18 (3 × 6 locations)     |
| 3 per Region   | 3 per region      | Any 3 locations within a region | 4 or more in a single region        | 6 (3 × 2 regions)        |
| 3 per Business | 3 in total        | Any location (L1-L6)            | More than 3, regardless of location | 3 (business-wide limit)  |

## How It Appears for Your Customers

Once the Trial Pack limit is reached, customers will not be able to purchase further Trial Packs until the reset period is over.

### Website Widget

Customers will see a prompt indicating if they are eligible for the Trial Pack based on their purchase history.
