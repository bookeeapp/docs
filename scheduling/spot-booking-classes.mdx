# Spot Booking in Classes

With the **Spot Booking** feature in Kenko CRM, you can offer a personalized booking experience. Whether it's a favorite Megaformer in a Lagree studio or a go-to bike in spin class — customers can now select their own spots before class begins.

<Tip>
  Spot Booking is a premium feature. To enable it, please contact your rep or email [support@bookeeapp.com](mailto:support@bookeeapp.com)
</Tip>

## Setting up Spot Booking in Kenko's CRM

### Facility Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Access Facility">
    Navigate to `Setup > Facility Creation` in the CRM. Click **Create Facility** for new or select an existing one to edit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Facility Details">
    Provide the basic information and upload a representative image to improve the booking interface in the customer app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Layout">
    Set the layout capacity and column count. This determines the interactive layout your customers will see.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Facility Map">
    Add a detailed layout image showing spot arrangement, instructor area, and any fixed equipment like racks or mirrors.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Spot Booking">
    Go to the Layout tab of an existing facility and click **Setup Now** to activate the Spot Booking feature.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<note>
  If a class was created before Spot Booking was enabled, spots won't be retroactively applied. Only new or unbooked events will inherit the layout.
</note>

## Assigning Spots to Classes

### New Class Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add New Class">
    Go to `Classes > Add Class` and complete the basic information.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Publish">
    Finalize the schedule. The class will appear in your calendar and customer-facing platforms.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Enable for Existing Classes
