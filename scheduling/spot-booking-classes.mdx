# Spot Booking in Classes

With the **Spot Booking** feature in Kenko CRM, you can offer a personalized booking experience. Whether it's a favorite Megaformer in a Lagree studio or a go-to bike in spin class â€” customers can now select their own spots before class begins.

<Tip>
  Spot Booking is a premium feature. To enable it, please contact your rep or email [support@bookeeapp.com](mailto:support@bookeeapp.com)

## Setting up Spot Booking in Kenko's CRM

### Facility Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Access Facility">
    Navigate to `Setup > Facility Creation` in the CRM. Click **Create Facility** for a new one or select an existing one to edit.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at11.59.39AM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Facility Details">
    **_Basic Details_**

    Provide the basic information about the facility (name, type, etc.) and upload an image to improve the booking interface for customers.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.00.29PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>

    **_General Availability_**

    Add the availability of the facility to avoid any overlap or double events.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.01.51PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>

    **_Facility Layout_**

    To enable Spot Booking, you need to configure the Facility layout as explained in the next steps.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.04.10PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Spot Booking">
    Go to the Layout tab of an existing/new facility and enable the **Toggle** to activate the Spot Booking feature.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.07.10PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Layout">
    Set the layout capacity and column count. This determines the interactive layout your customers will see when selecting spots.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.08.01PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Facility Map">
    Add a detailed layout image showing spot arrangement, instructor area, and any fixed equipment like racks or mirrors.

    <Tip>
      You can use Canva to draw a Top view of the Facility so that your customers exactly have an idea of how it looks.
    </Tip>
    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/-floor-plan-2.jpg"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Spot Labels">
    Edit the spot label by double-clicking on the spot and adding letters or emojis to it.

    _You can add up to 5 letters._

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.11.50PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If a class was created before Spot Booking was enabled, spots won't be retroactively applied to it. Only new or unbooked events will inherit the layout.
</Note>

## Assigning Spots to Classes

To enable Spot Booking, you must assign a facility with Spot Booking enabled to your class. This applies to both newly created and existing classes.

### Assigning a Spot-Enabled Facility to a New Class

When creating a new class inside Kenko:

1. Start by filling in the basic class details â€” such as the name, instructors, description, and recurrence.

   <div className="flex justify-center">
   <img
     src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.55.09PM.png"
     alt="New class setup basic details"
     className="max-w-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
   />

   </div>
2. While choosing the **facility**, be sure to select one that has the **Spot Booking toggle enabled** and a layout already configured.

   <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
   <img
     src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.56.59PM.png"
     alt="Facility selector with Spot Booking"
     className="max-w-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
   />

   </div>
3. Once saved and published, the class will appear in both the admin calendar and your customer-facing app or website.

   From here on, customers booking this class will be able to choose their preferred spot through the Website or App.

   <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
   <img
     src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-28at2.17.28PM.png"
     alt="Customer app spot booking interface"
     className="max-w-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
   />

   </div>

> ðŸ’¡ You can link multiple classes to the same facility â€” especially useful for studios with shared spaces like spin studios or group fitness halls.

### Enabling Spot Booking on an Existing Class

If you're updating an already-created class to support Spot Booking:

- Make sure a **facility** is assigned to the class.
- Confirm that the selected facility has **Spot Booking enabled** and has a defined layout.

Once both of these conditions are met, new or **unbooked future sessions** of that class will inherit the layout and display available spots to customers at the time of booking.

## Publishing for Customer Booking

_Once Spot Booking is fully configured_

- Customers will see an **interactive facility layout** during booking.
- They can pick their preferred spot visually â€” whether thatâ€™s a front-row mat, a corner bike, or a zone near the mirror.
- If no spot is chosen, the system will automatically assign one based on availability.

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-03-10at4.08.16PM.png"
  alt="Customer booking with spots"
  className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>

## Customer Experience

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Booking a Spot" icon="calendar-check">
    Customers go through the following flow when booking a class with Spot Booking enabled:

    a. **They view the class schedule** on a preferred date.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-28at3.11.03PM.png"
      alt="Class schedule view"
      className="max-w-[600px] max-h-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    b. **They choose a class** from the available list.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-28at3.15.30PM.png"
      alt="Choose class"
      className="max-w-[600px] max-h-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    c. They are shown a **live interactive layout** of the facility for that class. If the class's facility has Spot Booking enabled, theyâ€™ll be prompted to select a spot.

    > If no selection is made, the system will auto-assign a spot based on availability.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-28at3.25.05PM.png"
      alt="Live spot layout"
      className="max-w-[600px] max-h-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    d. **Customers choose their preferred spot** by tapping it.

    e. For better orientation, they can **view the facility map** which displays the real-life layout (instructor zone, mirrors, entry, etc.).

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-03-10at4.08.16PM.png"
      alt="Facility map preview"
      className="max-w-[600px] max-h-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    f. Upon **booking confirmation**, the spot is shown in the upcoming bookings section, clearly marked with the selected position.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-28at3.32.25PM.png"
      alt="Confirmation view"

    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Waitlist Handling" icon="user-clock">
    Kenkoâ€™s waitlist system supports both manual and automated modes:

    - **Manual Notifications**: Everyone on the waitlist is notified when a spot opens.
    - **Auto-Enrollment**: The system automatically books the next person in line when a spot becomes free.

    In either case, a **spot is automatically assigned** based on real-time availability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bring a Friend & Spot Booking" icon="users">
    If a customer has access to **Buddy Passes** through their membership:

    a. The customer can **add a friend** and proceed with booking.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-28at4.49.30PM.png"
      alt="Add friend"
      className="max-w-[400px] max-h-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    b. Once details are added, the **facility layout opens**, showing available spots.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-28at4.50.13PM-2.png"
      alt="Buddy spot layout"
      className="max-w-[400px] max-h-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    c. The main customer can select spots for both themselves and their guest(s).

    > Note: This feature only works if the customer has an eligible membership that supports "Bring a Friend".

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-28at4.52.23PM.png"
      alt="Select spots"
      className="max-w-[400px] max-h-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    After booking, each friend receives a separate **confirmation email with their assigned spot**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Booking for Someone Else" icon="people-arrows">
    Spot Booking also supports scenarios where a customer books for a **related contact**, such as a dependent or another registered user:

    a. The customer chooses a related contact from their linked profiles.

    <div className="flex justify-center gap-4 mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-28at5.20.26PM.png"

      className="max-w-[400px] max-h-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    b. The customer selects a spot on behalf of the contact.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-02-28at5.22.11PM.png"
      alt="Spot selection for related contact"
      className="max-w-[400px] max-h-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    > Once the booking is complete, the contact receives their confirmation along with their assigned spot.

    If the contact does not have a valid membership, the system will **allow purchasing a membership during checkout** while still holding the selected spot.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Spot Booking in the Customer App" icon="mobile">
    Spot Booking is fully supported in the **Kenko customer mobile app** and **website widget**.

    Customers get the same experience across both platforms, including:

    - Interactive layouts
    - Facility map previews
    - Confirmation views with assigned spots

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Feature Availability and Limitations

<Warning>
  - Spot Booking is only available for **classes**, not **appointments** or **courses**.
  - No custom labels or spot names are allowed yet (this is a future feature).
  - Admins cannot assign spots manually at the moment (feature coming soon).
  - Changing layout capacity **resets existing bookings** for that class.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Design Your Layout Before Enabling" icon="pen">
    Set up your facility map and column structure **before enabling the Spot Booking toggle**. Once enabled, this becomes the base layout customers interact with. Use tools like Canva for a clear top-down view of your studio.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Label Spots Clearly" icon="tags">
    Keep labels **short and intuitive** â€” up to 5 characters. Combine **letters, numbers, or emojis** (e.g., ðŸ§˜ A1, ðŸ’ª B3) to make spots easy to identify. This improves the customer experience and instructor visibility during check-in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Assign Spot-Enabled Facility Early" icon="building">
    Always select a **Spot Booking-enabled facility** during class creation. If you add a facility later, only unbooked future sessions will inherit the layout. Avoid retroactive edits to prevent inconsistencies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Facility Map for Orientation" icon="map">
    Upload a visual **facility map** that mirrors the real studio layout. This helps customers understand where each spot is in relation to the instructor, mirrors, or doors â€” especially in dark studios or packed rooms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don't Overwrite Layout Mid-Schedule" icon="exclamation">
    Changing the **layout capacity** resets existing bookings. Finalize your layout first, then attach it to classes. If changes are needed, ensure all affected customers are notified.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Before Going Live" icon="flask">
    Try a hidden or internal-only class to preview how Spot Booking behaves. Book as a test user, check how the layout displays, and confirm the confirmation flow. This minimizes customer confusion when you launch.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set Expectations with Auto-Assignment" icon="robot">
    Make it clear to customers: if they donâ€™t choose a spot, **the system will auto-assign one**. This keeps classes moving efficiently while giving flexibility to those who want specific locations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
