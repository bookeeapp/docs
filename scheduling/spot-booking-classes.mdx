## Setting up Spot Booking in Kenko's CRM

### Facility Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Access Facility">
    Navigate to `Setup > Facility Creation` in the CRM. Click **Create Facility** for a new one or select an existing one to edit.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at11.59.39AM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Facility Details">
    **_Basic Details_**

    Provide the basic information about the facility (name, type, etc.) and upload an image to improve the booking interface for customers.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.00.29PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>

    **_General Availability_**

    Add the availability of the facility to avoid any overlap or double events.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.01.51PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>

    **_Facility Layout_**

    To enable Spot Booking, you need to configure the Facility layout as explained in the next steps.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.04.10PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Spot Booking">
    Go to the Layout tab of an existing/new facility and enable the **Toggle** to activate the Spot Booking feature.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.07.10PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Layout">
    Set the layout capacity and column count. This determines the interactive layout your customers will see when selecting spots.

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.08.01PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Facility Map">
    Add a detailed layout image showing spot arrangement, instructor area, and any fixed equipment like racks or mirrors.

    <Tip>
      You can use Canva to draw a Top view of the Facility so that your customers exactly have an idea of how it looks.
    </Tip>
    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/-floor-plan-2.jpg"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Spot Labels">
    Edit the spot label by double-clicking on the spot and adding letters or emojis to it.

    _You can add up to 5 letters._

    <div style={{ display:"flex",justifyContent:"center" }}>
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-15at12.11.50PM.png"
      style={{ maxWidth:"80%",height:"auto",borderRadius:"8px" }}
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  If a class was created before Spot Booking was enabled, spots won't be retroactively applied to it. Only new or unbooked events will inherit the layout.
</Note>

        </div>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Waitlist Handling">

        Customers can assign a spot to a related contact. Confirmation includes the contact's name and assigned spot.

  <Accordion title="Viewing Assigned Spots">
    <Card>
      Navigate to `Calendar > [Class]` to view the attendee list and assigned spots. Spot Booking will show seat assignments inline for each participant.

      <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
      <img
        src="https://via.placeholder.com/600x400.png?text=Assigned+Spots+Calendar+View"
        alt="Assigned spots in calendar view"

      />

      </div>
    </Card>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Admin Booking Behavior">
    <Card>
      When admins book clients manually, spots are auto-assigned. This also applies to recurring classes where spots will be allocated automatically for each participant.
    </Card>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Third-Party Integration Behavior

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Behavior Overview">
    <Card>
      Bookings made via integrations such as **ClassPass**, **GymPass**, and **MyClubs** are automatically assigned spots by the system. These users cannot manually pick a spot, as their selections are made by the platform based on availability.
    </Card>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## Feature Availability and Limitations

<Warning>
  - Spot Booking is only available for **classes**, not **appointments** or **courses**.
  - No custom labels or spot names are allowed yet (this is a future feature).
  - Admins cannot assign spots manually at the moment (feature coming soon).
  - Changing layout capacity **resets existing bookings** for that class.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can customers pick different spots per class?">
    Yes, spot selection is independent for each class. Customers can choose a different spot each time they book.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if a customer cancels?">
    The spot is released and becomes available for other customers to book.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can customers change spots after booking?">
    They can, as long as the session hasn't started, and the new spot is available.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if multiple customers try to book the same spot?">
    First-come-first-confirmed logic is applied by the system, meaning the first customer to confirm their spot gets it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is Spot Booking available to all studio types?">
    Yes, as long as the business offers **classes** (Spot Booking is not supported for appointments or courses).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
