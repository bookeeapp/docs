## Adding an Appointment from Calendar

You can add one-off or recurring appointment sessions directly from the calendar interface.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Calendar">
    Navigate to the **Calendar** from the sidebar and click the **Add Event** button.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at12.46.44PM.png"
      alt="Add Appointment Event"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select 'Appointment'">
    Choose **Appointment** from the type options (Appointment, Class, Course, Blocked Time).

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at4.23.02PM.png"
      alt="Select Appointment Option"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Appointment Details">
    - Select the appointment type (e.g., Physiotherapy, Massage, Nutrition Consult)
    - Assign an instructor or facility (whichever is applicable)
    - Pick the date and time slot

    <Note>
      For appointments, the selection of either Instructor or Facility or both is essential as they are either Facility-led or Instructor-led
    </Note>
    You can also choose whether to or whether or not to send Notification about the appointment to the Customer(s)

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at4.26.14PM.png"
      alt="Appointment Details Input"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    - Set recurrence (optional)

    You can also select whether to repeat an appointment with selected customers over a period of time.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at4.28.37PM.png"
      alt="Appointment Details Input"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Availability and Add Appointment">
    Review the slot availability and click **Add Appointment** to finalize. The system will highlight any conflicts with another event incase the Facility or the Instructor are not available.

    For recurring appointments, it will display all future events and their availability conflicts. You can still choose whether to proceed with the appointment creation.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at4.30.16PM.png"
      alt="Confirm Availability"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Customer and Book" icon="user">
    Select the customer for the appointment and select a membership for them from which they wish to deduct the credits from.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at4.32.43PM.png"
      alt="Confirm Availability"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    You can choose whether to charge with credits or charge later.

    Quick-pay option is available too if it has been setup while creating the appointment in the setup module.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Appointments added from the calendar are **detached instances** â€” they don't follow the appointment type's default schedule unless explicitly made recurring.
</Note>

## Editing and Managing Existing Appointments

Click on any existing appointment in the calendar to access specific management actions.

All quick actions can be accessed by navigating to:

  <Accordion title="Cancel or Delete Appointment" icon="trash">
    In Kenko, you have the option to **cancel** or **delete** an appointment, depending on your needs. Here's how these two actions differ:

    ### Cancel Appointment:

    - **Effect on Bookings**: All bookings will be marked as "free cancellations." The session will remain on the calendar but with a "cancelled" status.
    - **Customer Notification**: You can choose whether or not to send a cancellation notification to customers.
    - **Reason for Cancellation**: You must select a reason such as "Staff Emergency," "Client Emergency," "Staff Sickness," etc.
    - **Impact on Future Occurrences**: Cancelling a single appointment will not affect future scheduled instances (if recurring). Only the specific instance will be marked as cancelled.

      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    ### Delete Appointment:

    - **Effect on Bookings**: Completely removes the appointment from the calendar, including all bookings. This action deletes the appointment entirely.
    - **Customer Notification**: You can choose whether or not to send a deletion notification to customers.
    - **Reason for Deletion**: You must select a reason such as "Staff Emergency," "Client Emergency," "Staff Sickness," etc.
    - **Impact on Future Occurrences**: Deleting an appointment removes it entirely from the schedule, including any future occurrences if it's a recurring appointment.

    </Note>

    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Recurring Appointments Nuances

When creating an appointment from the calendar, you can set it to **repeat** on a weekly pattern (e.g., every Monday and Wednesday).

<Info>
  This generates a recurring series â€” but still allows you to edit or cancel individual occurrences later.
</Info>

### Editing Recurring Series

- If you **edit the entire series**, changes apply to all future unbooked sessions
- If you only edit a single instance, it becomes **detached** and behaves independently

## When to Use Calendar vs Appointment Setup

| Use Case                                           | Best Module       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| One-off appointment / trial / holiday session      | Calendar          |
| Standard recurring appointment (e.g., "Mon 10 AM") | Appointment Setup |
| Special event or pop-up appointment                | Calendar          |
| Batch add 10\+ appointments at once                | Appointment Setup |

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Always Check for Conflicts" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Calendar will show warnings if your new appointment overlaps with another session using the same instructor or facility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Visibility Settings" icon="eye">
    Hide draft appointments from customers until you're ready to go live. You can toggle visibility anytime.

  <Card title="Use Recurrence for Predictable Patterns" icon="calendar-days">
    Recurring appointments keep your calendar cleaner and save time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Send Reminders via Group Message" icon="message">
    Messaging tools are great for reminding attendees, sharing pre-appointment prep, or cancellations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limit Changes After Booking" icon="lock">
    After customers are booked, avoid making significant changes to the schedule, as it may confuse them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Conflicts Regularly" icon="calendar-times">
    Periodically check for appointment overlaps and resource conflicts to ensure a smooth schedule.
