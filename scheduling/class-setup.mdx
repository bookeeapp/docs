# Class Setup

Setting up your class schedule is a core function of the Kenko platform. This guide walks you through creating and managing classes that your members can book.

## Understanding Class Components

Before creating your schedule, it's helpful to understand the building blocks of the Kenko class system:

- **Class Types**: Templates defining the attributes of a class (e.g., "Vinyasa Yoga")
- **Classes**: Specific instances of a class type on your schedule (e.g., "Monday 6pm Vinyasa Yoga")
- **Instructors**: Staff members who lead classes
- **Rooms/Resources**: Physical spaces or equipment needed for classes
- **Capacity**: Maximum number of participants allowed
