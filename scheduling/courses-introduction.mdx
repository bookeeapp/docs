# Courses in Kenko

Courses in Kenko allow you to deliver **structured, goal-oriented programs** that span multiple sessions — think **skill-building tracks**, **retreats**, or **teacher training modules**.

Each course is made up of **linked sessions** with shared enrollment and rules, giving you total control over pricing, visibility, capacity, and booking logic.

## How Courses Differ from Classes & Appointments

## Why Use Courses?

Courses provide structure and clarity for progressive programs. They’re best used when you want:

- A defined start and end date
- Consistent instructors or instructors rotating through predefined sessions
- One-time booking/payment that grants access to multiple sessions
- Grouped attendance reporting
- Fixed rosters and capacity enforcement

## Key Features of Courses

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Linked Sessions" icon="calendar-days">
    Each course is composed of **linked class templates** that define time, location, instructor, and recurrence. Once the course is published, sessions auto-populate into your CRM calendar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fixed Enrollment Logic" icon="lock">
    Customers **must book the entire course**, not individual sessions. This keeps rosters consistent and ensures full engagement throughout the program.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unified Pricing" icon="money-bill-trend-up">
    You can define course pricing as:

    - Fixed price (e.g., $150 for 10 sessions)
    - Credit-based (e.g., 5 credits for the full course)
      This pricing applies at the course level — not per session.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Capacity Control" icon="users-gear">
    The course enforces a single capacity across all sessions. Once it fills up, no additional customers can enroll — even if certain sessions show availability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Instructor Assignment & Visibility" icon="chalkboard-user">
    Instructors can be assigned globally or per session. Visibility rules allow you to show/hide instructor details to customers and control instructor-specific access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Progress Tracking & Roster Locking" icon="clipboard-check">
    Kenko automatically tracks who attended each session within a course. Rosters are locked after enrollment to prevent inconsistent participation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customer View" icon="mobile-screen">
    Courses show up under a dedicated tab in your app and web widget. Users can:

    - View upcoming course sessions
    - See description, instructors, and schedule
    - Enroll and track progress across sessions
