# Courses in Kenko's Calendar

Kenko's calendar allows you to not only view all courses but also schedule, modify, and manage them directly. This enables full control over your courses while ensuring easy accessibility for both admins and customers.

<Note>
  Unlike Classes and Appointments, you can only add Course instances in the calendar.
</Note>

This guide explains

- How to add a course instance from the calendar
- How to edit existing courses instances
- Communication and attendance tools available

## Adding a Course from Calendar

You can add one-off or recurring course sessions directly from the calendar interface.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Calendar">
    Navigate to the **Calendar** from the sidebar and click the **Add Event** button.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at12.46.44PM.png"
      alt="Add Course Event"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select 'Course'">
    Choose **Course** from the type options (Appointment, Class, Course, Blocked Time).

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at7.53.09PM.png"
      alt="Select Course Option"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Course Details">
    - Select a course group and course name from the already created courses in the Course Setup (this is mandatory).
    - Choose a facility for that particular course instance, A facility will pre-populate based on the initial course setup.
    - Pick the date and time slot for the course instance

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at7.53.23PM.png"
      alt="Course Details Input"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    <Note>
      There is not recurrence in Course instances as Courses are itself recurring in nature. Addition of Course instances are important if any special event has to be added in the already setup course schedule.
    </Note>
    <div className="flex justify-center" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Course instance and check availability">
    Review slot availability and click **Add Course** **instance** to finalize. The system will highlight any overlapping with another event or whether the course is outside the facility’s working hours.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at7.53.38PM.png"
      alt="Course Details Input"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    <div className="flex justify-center" />
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Courses added from the calendar are **detached instances** — they don't follow the course type's default schedule unless explicitly made recurring.

    - **Reason for Deletion**: You must select a reason such as "Staff Emergency," "Client Emergency," "Staff Sickness," etc.
    - **Impact on Future Occurrences**: Deleting a course removes it entirely from the schedule, including any future occurrences if it's a recurring course.
