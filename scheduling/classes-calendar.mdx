- When to use the calendar vs class setup
- Communication and attendance tools available

## Adding a Class from Calendar

You can add one-off or recurring class sessions directly from the calendar interface.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Calendar">
    Navigate to the **Calendar** from the sidebar and click the **Add Event** button.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at12.46.44PM.png"
      alt="Add Class Event"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select 'Class'">
    Choose **Class** from the type options (Appointment, Class, Course, Blocked Time).

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at12.47.12PM.png"
      alt="Select Class Option"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Class Details">
    - Select a class from the classes created in the **Class Setup** (this is mandatory).
    - Assign an instructor and a facility (optional).
    - Pick the date and time slot.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at12.57.32PM.png"
      alt="Class Details Input"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    - Set recurrence (optional).

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at12.59.54PM.png"
      alt="Recurrence Option"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Availability and Add Class">
    Review the slot availability and click **Add Class** to finalize. The system will highlight any conflicts with other events or if the class is outside of the facility's working hours.

    For recurring classes, it will display all future events and their availability conflicts. You can still choose whether to proceed with the class creation.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at1.02.33PM.png"
      alt="Confirm Availability"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Classes added from the calendar are **detached instances** — they don't follow the class type's default schedule unless explicitly made recurring.
</Note>

## Editing and Managing Existing Classes

Click on any existing class in the calendar to access specific management actions.

All quick actions can be accessed by navigating to:

**_Side Navbar \> Calendar \> Specific Class \> Sidebar_**

<div className="flex justify-center">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at2.04.44PM.png"
  alt="Calendar Class View"
  className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Book Customers" icon="user-plus">
    The integrated booking flow in the calendar allows you to book customers who have suitable memberships. For customers without memberships or with unsuitable memberships, there is a Purchase and Book flow.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at1.49.26PM.png"
      alt="Booking a Customer"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    While booking a customer into a class from the calendar, the admin has several options available:

    - **Charge with Credits**: Apply credits if the customer has a valid membership.
    - **Charge Later**: Allows payment to be collected at a later time.
    - **Single or Recurring Class**: You can choose to add the customer to a single class or recurring classes. The recurrence will depend on the class setup, either from the Setup module or the Calendar setup.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at1.53.42PM.png"
      alt="Charge with Credits or Book Later"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    - **Choose a Membership**: If the customer has multiple memberships, you can select which one to deduct credits from.
    - **Buy a New Membership**: If needed, purchase a new membership for the customer directly from the calendar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Send Group Message" icon="users">
    You can send emails or text messages to customers who are booked, waitlisted, or both, directly from the class's calendar view.

    _The "From" email address can be configured in the settings._

    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cancel or Delete Class" icon="trash">
    In Kenko, you have the option to **cancel** or **delete** a class, depending on your needs. Here’s how these two actions differ:

    ### Cancel Class:

    - **Effect on Bookings**: All bookings will be marked as "free cancellations." The session will remain on the calendar but with a "cancelled" status.
    - **Customer Notification**: You can choose whether or not to send a cancellation notification to customers.
    - **Reason for Cancellation**: You must select a reason such as "Staff Emergency," "Client Emergency," "Staff Sickness," etc.
    - **Impact on Future Occurrences**: Cancelling a single class will not affect future scheduled instances (if recurring). Only the specific instance will be marked as cancelled.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at2.29.02PM.png"
      alt="Cancel Class Screenshot"
      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>

    ### Delete Class:

    - **Effect on Bookings**: Completely removes the class from the calendar, including all bookings. This action deletes the class entirely.
    - **Customer Notification**: You can choose whether or not to send a deletion notification to customers.
    - **Reason for Deletion**: You must select a reason such as "Staff Emergency," "Client Emergency," "Staff Sickness," etc.
    - **Impact on Future Occurrences**: Deleting a class removes it entirely from the schedule, including any future occurrences if it's a recurring class.

      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Recording Link" icon="video">

    />

    </div>

    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customer Booking Status View" icon="stairs">
    An overview of customers who have booked into the class, are waitlisted, or have cancelled the class is shown in tabs in the class view of the calendar.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-21at2.50.27PM.png"

      className="max-w-[400px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Recurring Classes Nuances

When creating a class from the calendar, you can set it to **repeat** on a weekly pattern (e.g., every Monday and Wednesday).

<Info>
  This generates a recurring series — but still allows you to edit or cancel individual occurrences later.
</Info>

### Editing Recurring Series

- If you **edit the entire series**, changes apply to all future unbooked sessions
- If you only edit a single instance, it becomes **detached** and behaves independently

## When to Use Calendar vs Class Setup

| Use Case                                       | Best Module |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| One-off class / trial / holiday session        | Calendar    |
| Standard weekly class (e.g., "Wed 6 PM Zumba") | Class Setup |
| Special event class or pop-up format           | Calendar    |
| Batch add 10\+ sessions at once                | Class Setup |

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Always Check for Conflicts" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Calendar will show warnings if your new class overlaps with another session using the same instructor or facility.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Visibility Settings" icon="eye">
    Hide draft classes from customers until you're ready to go live. You can toggle visibility anytime.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Series for Predictable Patterns" icon="calendar-days">
    Recurring sessions keep your calendar cleaner and save time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Send Reminders via Group Message" icon="message">
    Messaging tools are great for reminding attendees, sharing pre-class prep, or cancellations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Limit Changes After Booking" icon="lock">
    After customers are booked, try to avoid making significant changes to the schedule or instructor, as it may cause confusion.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Class Conflicts Regularly" icon="calendar">
    Periodically check for class overlaps and resource conflicts to ensure a smooth schedule.
