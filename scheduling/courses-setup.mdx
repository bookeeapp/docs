# Courses Deep Dive

Kenko’s **Courses** module is designed to support structured, multi-session programs such as certifications, workshops, or progressive skill tracks. Unlike classes or appointments, courses have defined start/end dates, consistent instructors, and fixed batch sizes.

This guide walks through the full lifecycle: grouping, configuring, and scheduling courses.

## Course Lifecycle

Courses in Kenko can be created via

<Note>
  Navigating to the side **Nav-bar → Setup → Courses & Workshops**
</Note>

From here, you will be able to

- **Create Groups**: Organize multiple related courses under one umbrella
- **Create Courses**: Define the sessions, price, and rules for each course
- **Edit or Delete**: Modify future courses or clean up test versions
