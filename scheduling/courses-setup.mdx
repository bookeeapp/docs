# Courses in Kenko

Courses in Kenko are designed for structured, multi-session experiences — ideal for **bootcamps**, **progressive learning**, **retreats** and more.

Unlike regular classes or appointments, Courses are built as a **series of linked sessions** with clear start and end dates, fixed capacity, and controlled access. This structure ensures consistency in attendance, pricing, and curriculum delivery.

## What Makes Courses Unique?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Structured Progression" icon="layer-group">
    Courses are ideal for programs that require sequential participation across multiple sessions. Think of it as a fixed calendar of interdependent sessions rather than a recurring drop-in format.

    - Example: A 6-week Prenatal Yoga course held every Tuesday & Thursday at 6PM.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Single Purchase Access" icon="credit-card">
    Customers pay once to enroll in the full course — no per-session booking required.

    - Pricing can be flat (e.g., $99 for the course) or credit-based.
    - Course bookings do not allow partial sign-ups (unless you choose otherwise).
    - Customers can opt to use Payment plans to pay for the Course amount in Installments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Session Linking & Management" icon="calendar-days">
    Each course is tied to a specific number of sessions. Number of sessions is editable.

    Additional sessions can be added to the Course past it's end date and is entirely upto the Client's descretion.

    - Sessions are managed as a group and inherit course visibility and capacity rules.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Roster Consistency" icon="users-rectangle">
    Since enrollment happens once, Kenko tracks consistent attendance per customer across the entire course lifecycle.

    - Great for tracking progress in programs like Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced levels.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Central Visibility & Control" icon="eye">
    Admins get a central view of all courses under setup, their linked sessions, pricing, capacity, and booking status — making it easier to manage session-wide policies and performance.
  </Accordion>
