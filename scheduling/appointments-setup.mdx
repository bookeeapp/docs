## Appointment Configuration

Appointment setup is split into **2 stages** — Basic Details & Pricing.

### Basic Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Appointment Name" icon="boxing-glove">
    This is the primary label your customers will see when booking an appointment via the app or website.

    Make it concise and relevant to the type of service (e.g., “15-min Physio Check” or “1:1 Nutrition Consult”).

## Appointment Types in Kenko

| Criteria                    | **Facility-led**                                                                | **Instructor-led**                                                                  | **Facility \+ Instructor-led**                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**              | Appointment is tied to a facility only, no specific instructor is needed.       | Appointment is tied to a specific instructor only, no facility is assigned.         | Appointment depends on both a facility and an instructor being available at the same time. |
| **Use Case Examples**       | Infrared Sauna, Cryo Chamber, Tanning Booth                                     | Nutrition Consult, Therapy Session, Personal Training                               | Deep Tissue Massage, Physiotherapy with specialist in Studio B                             |
| **Booking Logic**           | Customer sees available time slots based on room or facility availability only. | Customer sees time slots based on instructor's calendar.                            | Customer sees time slots that match both instructor and facility availability.             |
| **Resource Conflict Check** | Facility conflict is checked, instructor is ignored.                            | Instructor conflict is checked, facility is ignored.                                | Both facility and instructor calendars are checked for conflicts.                          |
| **Customer Experience**     | Customer selects the service and time, no staff is shown.                       | Customer may select preferred instructor (if allowed) or pick from available slots. | Customer chooses a time where both staff and space are free, instructor name is shown.     |
| **Setup Requirements**      | Enable “Requires Facility”, Instructor toggle off                               | Enable “Requires Instructor”, Facility toggle off                                   | Enable both “Requires Facility” and “Requires Instructor”                                  |
| **Best Suited For**         | Equipment-based or room-only services without staff dependency                  | Personalized 1-on-1 services, therapy, training                                     | High-touch services needing private space and certified personnel                          |

## Appointment Slot Creation Logic

Kenko automatically generates bookable appointment slots based on a combination of configuration settings. Here's how each element plays a role:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Time Increments" icon="clock">
    This defines how frequently new slots appear for booking.

    | Increment Setting | Example Slots Generated |
    | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
    | 5 minutes         | 9:00, 9:05, 9:10, 9:15  |
    | 10 minutes        | 9:00, 9:10, 9:20, 9:30  |
    | 15 minutes        | 9:00, 9:15, 9:30, 9:45  |

    - Shorter increments offer more granular options for shorter services.
    - Longer increments are ideal for appointments requiring more setup or turnaround.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Service Duration" icon="hourglass-half">
    The core duration of the appointment itself (e.g., 30, 45, or 60 minutes). Kenko ensures the duration fits within both resource and availability blocks.

    If duration = 30 minutes and increment = 15 minutes, overlapping slots like these may appear:

    - 9:00–9:30
    - 9:15–9:45
    - 9:30–10:00
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Buffer Time (Pre & Post)" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Kenko supports adding buffer time before and after each service to allow for prep, cleanup, or transition.

    | Buffer Type | Description            | Example                |
    | ----------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
    | Pre-buffer  | Setup/prep time        | 5 minutes before start |
    | Post-buffer | Cleanup/recovery/reset | 10 minutes after end   |

    If a 30-minute service has 5 min pre-buffer and 10 min post-buffer, Kenko blocks 45 mins total.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Instructor & Facility Availability" icon="user-clock">
    Slots are only generated when required resources are simultaneously available:

    - Instructor-led: Only checks instructor availability.
    - Facility-led: Only checks facility availability.
    - Facility \+ Instructor-led: Checks both calendars simultaneously (including buffers).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Working Hours & Time Blocks" icon="calendar-days">
    Each instructor and facility has defined working hours. Time outside this window is not eligible for slot generation. Instructors can also block out specific hours or days as unavailable which is known as Block Time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conflict & Suppression Logic" icon="ban">
    Slots are automatically suppressed if:

    - They overlap with existing bookings (including buffers).
    - They conflict with instructor or facility schedules.
    - They fall outside allowed windows or working hours.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example Scenario" icon="eyes">
    - **Service Duration**: 30 mins
    - **Pre-buffer**: 5 mins
    - **Post-buffer**: 10 mins
    - **Increment**: 15 mins
    - **Available window**: 9:00 AM – 12:00 PM
    - **Resources Required**: Instructor \+ Facility

    **Generated Slots**:

    - 9:00 – 9:45
    - 9:15 – 10:00
    - 9:30 – 10:15
    - 9:45 – 10:30
    - 11:15 – 12:00

    Only if both the instructor and facility are available during the full buffered window.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
