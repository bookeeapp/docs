# Classes in Kenko's Platform

**Classes** are the foundational building block of any schedule in Kenko. Whether you're offering yoga, strength training, martial arts, or dance — everything revolves around the structure and flexibility that the **Class** module provides.

Each class session defines a **what**, **where**, **when**, **who**, and **how many** — and links tightly with other modules such as the calendar, instructor tools, facility availability, customer check-in, waitlists, and cancellations.

## Classes are central to

## What Makes Up a Class?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Class Name & Type" icon="input-text">
    Every class should have a **clear, unique, and easily recognizable name**. This is the name that customers see on your website, app, and booking screens.

    - Add context to the name, e.g. “Beginner Yoga” vs “Power Yoga Express”
    - Assign each class to a **Class Type** (e.g., Strength, Mindfulness, HIIT) to organize filters, apply category-level pricing, and track analytics
    - Class Types also power calendar color-coding and help staff quickly distinguish between different offerings

    **Best practice:** Prefix classes with level tags (“Beginner”, “Intermediate”) or specialty tags (“Prenatal”, “Restorative”) for easier discoverability.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Location & Facility" icon="location-dot">
    Classes are tied to **specific rooms, zones, or studio locations**.

    - Prevents double-booking by locking a class into a facility
    - Supports multi-location setups with facility-specific calendars
    - Allows reporting by room usage (e.g., Studio A occupancy rates)

    You can predefine facility names in the Settings section (e.g., “Main Studio”, “Rooftop Zone”, “Therapy Room”).

    **Note:** If left unassigned, a class may allow scheduling conflicts or confuse front desk teams.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Instructor(s)" icon="person-chalkboard">
    Every class needs at least one assigned instructor.

    - Instructors see only their assigned classes in their calendar view
    - Substitution workflows rely on this field — only assigned instructors can initiate or be replaced
    - Classes can have multiple instructors for co-led sessions (e.g., "Couples Acro Yoga")

    You can set **default instructors** for specific class types to save time during bulk creation.

    **Visibility control:** Admins can restrict which instructors can edit or view class details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Recurrence & Timing" icon="timer">
    You can create:

    - One-time classes (e.g., Special Events)
    - Recurring classes (e.g., Every Monday & Wednesday at 7:00 PM)
    - Limited-run recurrences (e.g., “Every Sunday for 6 weeks”)

    Available recurrence patterns:

    - Daily / Weekly / Custom Days
    - End conditions: never ends, ends after X sessions, ends by date

    Set:

    - Start time and end time
    - Duration (automatically inferred from start/end but editable for reporting purposes)

    **Conflict detection** is active — if any part of the recurrence overlaps with existing classes (instructor or room), you’ll be notified.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Capacity & Visibility" icon="users-viewfinder">
    Define how many people can join a class:

    - Set maximum capacity (e.g., 12 mats, 16 bikes)
    - Waitlist activates once capacity is reached (if enabled)
    - Real-time updates on availability shown to customers

    Visibility options:

    - **Public**: Listed everywhere (app, site, widget)
    - **Private**: Only bookable via direct link
    - **Hidden**: For internal use, not bookable by customers

    You can also toggle whether the class shows in instructor calendars or not (useful for testing or staff trainings).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bookability & Restrictions" icon="check-to-slot">
    Decide who can book this class:

    - All customers
    - Members only
    - Only those with active packs
    - Only after waiver forms are signed

    Additional options:

    - Booking window: “Can book only up to 2 hours before class”
    - Restrict bookings to web or app only
    - Limit per user per day/week (e.g., max 1 booking per day)

    These controls help manage fairness, resource load, and avoid last-minute operational chaos.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cancellation Policy" icon="ban">
    Attach a class-level or global cancellation rule:

    - Minimum notice required to cancel (e.g., 2 hrs)
    - No-show fee or credit deduction
    - Refund eligibility (partial, full, or none)

    These policies trigger automated notifications and apply across customer journeys (booking confirmations, cancellations, etc.)

    **Tip:** You can define multiple cancellation policies in Settings and reuse them across class types.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integration with Google Calendar" icon="google">
    Classes get linked to Google Calendar which instantly syncs with the Instructor's and Staff's Google Calendar for a better visibility while Mobile.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Summary

Classes in Kenko are not just calendar blocks — they are deeply connected entities that sync with

- **Instructor tools** and substitution workflows
- **Customer journeys** from discovery to check-in
- **Operational logic** like capacity, attendance, and policies
- **Facility scheduling** and availability conflict management

Each of these connections will be explored in more detail throughout the following sections.
