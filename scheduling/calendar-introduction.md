# Calendar Introduction

The **Calendar** in Kenko is your operational hub to view, manage, and schedule every session — including classes, appointments, and courses. Whether you're an instructor managing your day, a front desk adding last-minute bookings, or an owner tracking occupancy, the calendar provides a real-time, customizable experience.

## Calendar Functionalities at a Glance

The calendar is accessible via \*\*Nav-bar → Calendar\*\* in Kenko CRM.

### What You Can Do with the Calendar

See every scheduled session — including Classes, Appointments, and Course Sessions — all in one interface. Choose from Day, Week, Instructor, or Facility-based layouts depending on how you want to organize and manage sessions.

```
<div className="flex justify-center mt-4" />
```

Narrow your view using filters like Instructor, Facility, Appointment Type, and Session Category. Quickly add walk-in customers or manually book participants into existing or new sessions. Instantly see how many customers are booked and what resources are assigned to a session. Adjust session time, instructor, or capacity — all from the calendar, with edit permissions. Appointments don’t auto-populate. Add time slots for services manually through the calendar. Effortlessly reschedule any class or appointment by dragging the session block to a new time.

## Views and Layouts

Best for managing real-time check-ins and instructor overlaps. You can track who’s on duty and see multiple session types side-by-side.

```
<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.52.11PM.png"
  alt="Day view layout"
  className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>
```

Ideal for balancing instructor availability and overall session load. Great for high-level planning across departments.

```
<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.52.56PM.png"
  alt="Week view layout"
  className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>
```

Shows sessions grouped by instructor. This view makes it easier to check staff utilization, avoid overload, and filter by individual instructors directly from the UI.

```
<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.53.43PM.png"
  alt="Instructor view layout"
  className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>
```

Breaks the calendar down by room or location. This view is perfect for maximizing space usage and avoiding facility double-bookings. You can also filter each facility individually.

```
<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.54.21PM.png"
  alt="Facility view layout"
  className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>
```

## Features at a Glance

Each type of session is color-coded

```
- **Classes**: Based on class color tag
- **Appointments**: Based on type or instructor
- **Courses**: Use assigned course group color

Use this to visually track session types, instructors, and facility load.
```

\- \*\*Filter by Category of services\*\* - \*\*Filter by Intructor\*\* - \*\*Filter by Facility\*\*

```
This allows front-desk teams to quickly narrow down what they need to see.
```

\### For Classes

```
- View full roster and attendance
- Book or cancel clients manually
- Manage waitlisted customers
- Check spot selection (if Spot Booking is enabled)
- Send communication to customers in a class

### For Appointments

- Add a new appointment manually to calendar
- Assign a client to instructor/facility
- Track attendance 

### For Courses

- View session-wise breakdown under course color
- Add clients to course sessions
- Track who has completed or missed sessions
```

Unlike Classes, \*\*Appointments do not auto-populate on the calendar\*\*. They must be explicitly added via the calendar to appear.

```
<Note>
  When you add an appointment to the calendar, Kenko will prompt you to assign a customer immediately.
</Note>
This gives greater flexibility to personalize instructor availability and appointment offerings without default blocks.

## Best Practices

Week view provides the best balance between detail and planning for both front desk and admin roles. Use consistent color tags to distinguish session types, difficulty, or location at a glance. Train your staff to use filters so they only view sessions relevant to their shift or role. Setup availability in the Appointment module, then add slots directly on the calendar as needed.
