# Facility Setup

Facilities in Kenko are the physical or virtual spaces where appointments and classes take place â€” such as a therapy room, spin studio, online room, or massage cabin. This guide walks through creating and configuring them.

## Key Concepts

- **Facility**: A bookable space where classes or appointments can be scheduled
- **Simultaneous Appointments**: Set how many clients can be booked at once (ideal for semi-private offerings)
- **Availability**: Define when the facility can be used
- **Spot Booking**: Enable interactive layouts where customers select their preferred location in a room (e.g., bike 5, reformer 2)

## Setting Up a Facility

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Facility Setup">
    Navigate to **Setup** â†’ **Facility** in the left-hand panel of the CRM.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New Facility">
    Click **Create Facility** to begin.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter Basic Details">
    - **Facility Name**: Give it a clear label (e.g., "Room A", "Cryotherapy Room")
    - **Description**: Add any helpful notes for internal use
    - **Simultaneous Appointments**: Choose how many clients can be booked at once

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
      <img
        src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at1.01.31PM.png"
        alt="Facility basic details"
        className="max-w-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
      />
    </div>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set General Availability">
    Define when this facility is open for bookings:
    - **Start Date** (and optional end date)
    - **Days of the Week**
    - **Repeat Frequency** (e.g., every 1 week)

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
      <img
        src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at1.02.58PM.png"
        alt="Facility availability setup"
        className="max-w-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
      />
    </div>

    You can also configure time slots for each selected day:

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
      <img
        src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at1.03.10PM.png"
        alt="Add time slot"
        className="max-w-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
      />
    </div>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Spot Booking (Optional)">
    Turn on Spot Booking if you want customers to pick a specific spot (like a mat or bike) while booking.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
      <img
        src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at1.03.17PM.png"
        alt="Enable spot booking layout"
        className="max-w-[600px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
      />
    </div>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Facility">
    Once setup is complete, click **Create Facility** to finalize the configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Things to Know

- You can create multiple facilities to match your studio layout and services.
- A facility can host both appointments and classes.
- Facility layout (for Spot Booking) can be customized with labels, instructor zones, and mirrors.
- Facility availability directly impacts which services can be scheduled during which time windows.

If you're planning to enable Spot Booking or multi-client sessions, configure layout and capacity accordingly.

<Info>
  Changes made to availability or layout of an active facility will affect future, unbooked sessions.

You can add multiple ranges â€” e.g., 9:00â€“10:00 AM and 5:00â€“7:00 PM â€” to reflect breaks or downtime.

### 4. Facility Layout (Optional)

If the facility supports **Spot Booking**, enable and define the layout here.

<div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
<img
  src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at1.03.17PM.png"
  alt="Facility layout and spot booking toggle"
  className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
/>

</div>

- Toggle **Spot Booking** on.
- Youâ€™ll be able to configure an interactive layout with spots that customers can choose from.

> ðŸ’¡ Spot booking is ideal for formats like spin studios, reformer classes, or mat-based group sessions.

## Key Benefits of Facility Setup

- Prevents **double-booking** or space conflicts
- Enables **real-time availability** tracking across appointments and classes
- Supports **resource planning** (e.g., assigning instructors, adjusting time slots)
- Powers **Spot Booking** through layout configuration

---

## Next Steps

Once a facility is created, it can be:

- Assigned to **classes** (recurring group events)
- Linked to **appointments** (1-on-1 or semi-private sessions)
- Used as a base for **spot booking** configuration

You can always edit facility settings from `Setup â†’ Facility` in the Kenko admin panel.
