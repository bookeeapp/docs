## Things to Know

- You can create multiple facilities to match your studio layout and services.
- A facility can host appointments, courses and classes.
- Facility layout (for Spot Booking) can be customized with labels..
- Facility availability directly impacts which services can be scheduled during which time windows.

If you're planning to enable Spot Booking or multi-client sessions, configure layout and capacity accordingly.

<Info>
  Changes made to availability or layout of an active facility will affect future, unbooked sessions.
