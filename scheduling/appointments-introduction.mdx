# Appointments in Kenko

Appointments in Kenko allow for **1-on-1 or small group services** to be booked with instructors across flexible time slots. Whether it’s personal training, physiotherapy, massage, assessments, or coaching — appointments are designed to be service-specific, staff-availability-driven, and highly customizable.

## What Makes Appointments Unique?

Unlike classes, which are scheduled on fixed days and times, **appointments work off Instructor or Facility availability**. They are **dynamic**, **real-time**, and rely on the system's ability to check

- Service durations
- Buffers before/after
- Instructor working hours
- Facility usage

Customers see only time slots that satisfy all conditions.

## Core Appointment Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Service-Based Configuration">
    Appointments are created as **individual services** (e.g., “30-Min Physio”, “60-min Massage”, “1:1 Assessment”).

    Each service has:

    - A fixed **duration**
    - Allowed **instructors**
    - Optional **facility**
    - Pricing (credits or free)
    - Custom cancellation policy

    Services are then grouped into categories for discoverability in the booking interface.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Instructor-Driven Availability">
    Appointment booking times are based on:

    - Instructor’s **working hours**
    - Existing bookings
    - Service-level duration \+ buffers

    If an instructor is unavailable or has time blocked off (e.g., meetings, personal breaks), those slots won’t appear.

    Each instructor can also specify:

    - Days they are available for appointments
    - Maximum number of appointments per day
    - Auto-approval or manual approval preferences
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Buffer Management & Flexibility">
    Buffers help ensure smooth transitions between sessions.

    - You can define buffer time **before and/or after** a session.
    - These buffers are invisible to the customer but respected in calendar logic.
    - Example: A 60-min massage with a 15-min post-buffer will block 75 mins total in the instructor's calendar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Recurring Appointments">
    Customers can optionally book recurring appointments (e.g., every Tuesday at 3 PM).

    - Recurrence depends on availability across all requested dates.
    - If any slot is unavailable, the system notifies the customer before confirming.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Booking for Someone Else & Dependencies">
    Customers can book appointments on behalf of:

    - Family members
    - Children
    - Other saved profiles (e.g., athletes, patients)

    The system shows eligibility and credits for the selected contact, and appointment confirmations reflect their name.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Visibility, Eligibility & Rules">
    - Appointments can be public or visible only via direct links
    - Booking restrictions include:
      - Credit pack requirements
      - Membership eligibility
      - Tag-based visibility (e.g., only for “Gold” members)
    - Custom cancellation & no-show rules can be applied per service
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Integration Behavior">
    Appointment bookings via **Gympass** and **MyClubs** are **auto-assigned** to instructors based on availability.

    - These platforms do not allow customers to pick a specific instructor
    - Only services enabled for these integrations will show up on their platforms
    - Reporting and payout logic flows through your existing aggregator contract
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
