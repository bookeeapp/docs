### 2. Schedule

You’ll define when and how often the class occurs.

- **Repeat Schedule Every**: Choose the recurrence interval (e.g., every 1 week).
- **Select Days**: Pick one or more weekdays (e.g., Mon, Wed, Fri).
- **Add Time Slots**: Add a start and end time (e.g., 7:00 AM – 8:00 AM)

  Once you choose a day, you’ll see the **Time-slot settings**:
  - **Facility** (reconfirmation)
  - **Instructors** (if not global)
  - **Class size** (can override the global cap)
- **Apply to All**: Apply the same settings across all selected weekdays.
- **Check for Conflicts**: Validates for overlapping instructors or room allocations.

### 3. Pricing

Classes can be:

- **Credit-based**
- **Free**

If credit-based:

- Choose between **One credit per class** or **Multiple credits**
- Set booking eligibility:
  - All pricing options
  - Specific pricing rules (e.g., only valid for Premium packs or Monthly Passes)

## Editing a Class: Behavioral Nuances

Kenko’s class behavior is designed to preserve historical integrity and avoid unintentional disruptions. Here’s what happens under the hood when you edit existing classes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="🔁 Changing Recurrence">
    - If you change the **start date** or **end date**, all **unbooked future events** between the old and new range will be deleted.
    - If you remove a time slot (e.g., remove Fridays), those sessions become **detached**. They no longer update based on the class template.
    - This protects against accidental deletion of already booked sessions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="👥 Changing Instructors">
    - You can swap out instructors at the session level or globally across all recurring events.
    - Changes only apply to **unbooked or editable** sessions.
    - Substitute tracking is handled automatically if the original instructor was removed mid-schedule.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="🛠️ Schedule-Level Edits">
    - Editing fields like capacity, facility, or time will **only affect future, unbooked occurrences**.
    - Booked sessions retain original details to preserve customer expectations and historical data.
    - You can override specific sessions individually by detaching them from the template.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
