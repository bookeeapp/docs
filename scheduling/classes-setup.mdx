<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Recurring Schedule" icon="arrows-repeat">
    Choose how often the class repeats, whether it's daily, weekly, or custom intervals.

    - **Recurring Interval**: Choose an interval like “1 week” for weekly classes or “every 2 weeks” for bi-weekly events.
    - This ensures that classes are scheduled automatically, and you don’t need to manually set up each occurrence.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-14at6.07.48PM.png"
      alt="Recurring schedule"

    </div>

  <Accordion title="Select Days" icon="calendar-day">
    Select the days on which the class will occur. You can pick multiple weekdays like Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or just one day for a less frequent schedule.

    - This flexibility helps you tailor the schedule to your customer needs and your staff’s availability.

    <div className="flex justify-center">
    <img

    </div>

    <Info>
      You can add multiple time slots on a single day, which will create two separate occurrences of the class on that day.
    </Info>
    **Override Global Settings**: If necessary, you can make adjustments to certain time slots without affecting the entire class. This is particularly useful if:

    - **Facility** needs to change for a specific session
    - **Instructor** is unavailable, so you want to assign a substitute for certain dates
    - **Class Size** needs to be adjusted for a specific session (for example, during a special workshop)

    - This makes scheduling faster and ensures consistency across the entire series of classes.

    This flexibility allows you to align pricing with session length, exclusivity, or membership levels.

    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-14at7.33.08PM.png"

## Editing a Class

Kenko’s class behavior is designed to preserve historical integrity and avoid unintentional disruptions. 

<Note>
  You can edit the class by Navigating to **Setup \> Classes \> Select an exisitng class and click on Edit**
</Note>

Here’s what happens when you edit existing classes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Change Recurrence" icon="repeat">
    - If you change the **start date** or **end date**, all **unbooked future events** between the old and new range will be deleted.
    - If you remove a time slot (e.g., removing Fridays), those sessions will become **detached**. This means that those sessions will no longer be linked to the original class template and will not be updated with future changes (e.g., instructor or facility changes).
    - **Detached classes** are essentially stand-alone occurrences that no longer follow the recurring class template.
    - This ensures that already booked sessions remain unchanged and aren’t unintentionally deleted.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Change Instructors" icon="chalkboard-user">
    - You can swap instructors at the session level or globally for all recurring events.
    - The change will **only apply to unbooked or editable sessions**.
    - If you remove an instructor mid-schedule, the system will automatically handle **substitute tracking** to ensure continuity for your customers.
    - Any changes made to the instructor assignment for future sessions will be applied seamlessly to those unbooked events.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Schedule-Level Edits" icon="calendar-days">
    - Editing fields like **capacity**, **facility**, or **time slots** will **only affect future, unbooked occurrences**.
    - **Booked sessions** retain their original details to preserve customer expectations and avoid confusion. These sessions will remain intact, and customers won’t be notified of changes that impact their bookings.
    - If needed, you can override specific sessions (e.g., a particular class on a specific day) by detaching them from the template. This allows you to modify those individual sessions without affecting the entire recurring schedule.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

    Always run the conflict checker after adding time slots — this prevents instructor or facility overlap errors.

    Pick a standard color scheme for live, virtual, or specialty formats to make admin navigation easier.
  </Card>
