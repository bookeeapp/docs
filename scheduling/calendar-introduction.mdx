# Introduction to Kenko's Calendar

The **Calendar** in Kenko is your operational hub to view, manage, and schedule every session — including classes, appointments, and courses. Whether you're an instructor managing your day, a front desk adding last-minute bookings, or an owner tracking occupancy, the calendar provides a real-time, customizable experience.

## Calendar Functionalities at a Glance

The calendar is accessible via **Nav-bar → Calendar** in Kenko CRM.

### What You Can Do with the Calendar

- **View all sessions** — including Classes, Appointments, and Course Sessions
- **Switch Views** — Day, Week, and Month views for granular or high-level planning
- **Filter by Resource** — Instructors, Facilities, or Appointment Types
- **Book on the Fly** — Add walk-in customers directly to sessions or create new bookings manually
- **Check Occupancy & Attendees** — See real-time signups and assigned resources
- **Edit Sessions** — Modify time, instructor, or capacity with permission
- **Add Appointments** — Since appointments don’t auto-populate, they must be explicitly added via the calendar
- **Drag-and-Drop** — Reschedule classes or appointments directly on the interface

## Views and Layouts

| View      | Best Used For                         | Features                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Day**   | Micro-view of instructor or facility  | Focus on hourly details & availability |
| **Week**  | Most popular for operational planning | Balance between overview & granularity |
| **Month** | Forecasting and batch reschedules     | Quick glance over load & time gaps     |

You can toggle between these using the top-right calendar selector.

## Color Coding & Tags

Each type of session is color-coded:

- **Classes**: Based on class color tag
- **Appointments**: Based on type or instructor
- **Courses**: Use assigned course group color

Use this to visually track session types, instructors, and facility load.

## Filters and Search

The calendar supports powerful filtering options:

- **Filter by Instructor**
- **Filter by Facility**
- **Filter by Appointment Type**
- **Show Only Spot Booking Classes**
- **Search by Class or Course name**

This allows front-desk teams to quickly narrow down what they need to see.

## Actions from Calendar

## Appointment Specific Behavior

Unlike Classes, **Appointments do not auto-populate on the calendar**. They must be explicitly added via the calendar to appear.

<Note>
  When you add an appointment to the calendar, Kenko will prompt you to assign a customer immediately.
</Note>

This gives greater flexibility to personalize instructor availability and appointment offerings without default blocks.

## Mobile & Tablet Friendly

Kenko’s calendar adjusts to mobile and tablet viewports so instructors and admins can manage operations on-the-go.

You can:

- Switch views easily
- Check customer names
- Tap sessions to view attendance
- Add customers in real time
