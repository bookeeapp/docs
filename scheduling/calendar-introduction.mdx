# Introduction to Kenko's Calendar

The **Calendar** in Kenko is your operational hub to view, manage, and schedule every session — including classes, appointments, and courses. Whether you're an instructor managing your day, a front desk adding last-minute bookings, or an owner tracking occupancy, the calendar provides a real-time, customizable experience.

## Calendar Functionalities at a Glance

<Note>
  The calendar is accessible via **Nav-bar → Calendar** in Kenko CRM.

## Views and Layouts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Day View">
    Best for managing real-time check-ins and instructor overlaps. You can track who’s on duty and see multiple session types side-by-side.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.52.11PM.png"
      alt="Day view layout"
      className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Week View">
    Ideal for balancing instructor availability and overall session load. Great for high-level planning across departments.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.52.56PM.png"
      alt="Week view layout"
      className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Instructor View">
    Shows sessions grouped by instructor. This view makes it easier to check staff utilization, avoid overload, and filter by individual instructors directly from the UI.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.53.43PM.png"
      alt="Instructor view layout"
      className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Facility View">
    Breaks the calendar down by room or location. This view is perfect for maximizing space usage and avoiding facility double-bookings. You can also filter each facility individually.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.54.21PM.png"
      alt="Facility view layout"
      className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Features at a Glance

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Colour Coding and Tags" icon="tags">
    Each type of session is color-coded

    - **Classes**: Based on class color tag
    - **Appointments**: Based on type or instructor
    - **Courses**: Use assigned course group color

    Use this to visually track session types, instructors, and facility load.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Filters Events" icon="filters">
    - **Filter by Category of services**
    - **Filter by Intructor**
    - **Filter by Facility**

    This allows front-desk teams to quickly narrow down what they need to see.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Calendar Quick Actions" icon="sparkles">
