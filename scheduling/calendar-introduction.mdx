# Introduction to Kenko's Calendar

The **Calendar** in Kenko is your operational hub to view, manage, and schedule every session — including classes, appointments, and courses. Whether you're an instructor managing your day, a front desk adding last-minute bookings, or an owner tracking occupancy, the calendar provides a real-time, customizable experience.

## Calendar Functionalities at a Glance

<Note>
  The calendar is accessible via **Nav-bar → Calendar** in Kenko CRM.

## Views and Layouts

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Day View">
    Best for managing real-time check-ins and instructor overlaps. You can track who’s on duty and see multiple session types side-by-side.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.52.11PM.png"
      alt="Day view layout"
      className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Week View">
    Ideal for balancing instructor availability and overall session load. Great for high-level planning across departments.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.52.56PM.png"
      alt="Week view layout"
      className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Instructor View">
    Shows sessions grouped by instructor. This view makes it easier to check staff utilization, avoid overload, and filter by individual instructors directly from the UI.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.53.43PM.png"
      alt="Instructor view layout"
      className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Facility View">
    Breaks the calendar down by room or location. This view is perfect for maximizing space usage and avoiding facility double-bookings. You can also filter each facility individually.

    <div className="flex justify-center mt-4">
    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-04-16at6.54.21PM.png"
      alt="Facility view layout"
      className="max-w-[700px] w-full rounded-lg shadow-sm"
    />

    </div>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Color Coding & Tags

Each type of session is color-coded:

- **Classes**: Based on class color tag
- **Appointments**: Based on type or instructor
- **Courses**: Use assigned course group color

Use this to visually track session types, instructors, and facility load.

---

## Filters and Search

The calendar supports powerful filtering options:

- **Filter by Instructor**
- **Filter by Facility**
- **Filter by Appointment Type**
- **Show Only Spot Booking Classes**
- **Search by Class or Course name**

This allows front-desk teams to quickly narrow down what they need to see.

---

## Actions from Calendar

### For Classes:

- View full roster and attendance
- Book or cancel clients manually
- Change instructors or detach a session
- Check spot selection (if Spot Booking is enabled)

### For Appointments:

- Add a new appointment manually to calendar
- Assign a client to instructor/facility
- Reschedule by drag-and-drop
- Track attendance and notes

### For Courses:

- View session-wise breakdown under course color
- Add clients to course sessions
- Track who has completed or missed sessions

---

## Appointment Specific Behavior

Unlike Classes, **Appointments do not auto-populate on the calendar**. They must be explicitly added via the calendar to appear.

<Note>
  When you add an appointment to the calendar, Kenko will prompt you to assign a customer immediately.
</Note>

This gives greater flexibility to personalize instructor availability and appointment offerings without default blocks.

---

## Mobile & Tablet Friendly

Kenko’s calendar adjusts to mobile and tablet viewports so instructors and admins can manage operations on-the-go.

You can:

- Switch views easily
- Check customer names
- Tap sessions to view attendance
- Add customers in real time
