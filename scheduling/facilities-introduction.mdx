# Facilities in Kenko

Facilities in Kenko represent **physical or virtual spaces** where your services take place — such as rooms, studios, zones, or even Zoom-based venues. They’re foundational to conflict resolution, scheduling logistics, spot-based layouts, and instructor visibility.

If Classes, Appointments, and Courses define the *what*, Facilities define the *where*.

---

## What is a Facility?

A Facility can be:

- A physical studio or room (e.g., “Room A – Floor 2” or “Spin Zone”)
- A virtual space (e.g., “Online – Zoom”)
- A specialized zone (e.g., “Massage Table 3” or “Assessment Bay”)

Facilities are **reusable across multiple services** and help control availability, instructor assignments, and booking logic.

## Why Facilities Matter

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scheduling Conflict Checks" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Kenko automatically checks for scheduling collisions when assigning instructors or rooms to classes and appointments. This prevents overbooking the same room or instructor at the same time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Instructor & Resource Visibility" icon="eye">
    Instructors can be linked to specific facilities. Their calendar visibility and booking permissions depend on what facilities they’re assigned to.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Spot Booking Integration" icon="border-all">
    For studios using **Spot Booking**, facilities allow you to upload **interactive layouts**, define columns and capacity, and enable customers to select specific spots during booking.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Used Across Services" icon="arrows-left-right">
    Facilities are used across:
    - **Classes** (to define physical room & avoid double bookings)
    - **Appointments** (to assign therapy rooms, private zones, etc.)
    - **Courses** (sessions inherit facility settings from linked classes)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Operational Analytics & Filtering" icon="chart-column">
    Reports and calendar views can be filtered by facility to understand how different spaces are utilized — helping you manage capacity, optimize scheduling, and forecast needs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Facility Setup Overview

To create or edit facilities, navigate to:

<Note>
  **CRM → Setup → Facilities**
</Note>

Here’s what you can define for each facility:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Name & Type" icon="keyboard">
    Give the facility a name (e.g., “Room A”) and define whether it’s a class space, appointment room, or virtual.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Upload Image" icon="image">
    Images help customers identify the space — especially useful for Spot Booking previews.
  </Card>

  <Card title="General Availability" icon="clock">
    Define working hours or restrict usage to certain time windows. This controls when services can be scheduled.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Facility Layout" icon="grid">
    Optional — used only for Spot Booking. Upload a custom layout, set columns, and configure spot-level behavior.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Enable Spot Booking" icon="bullseye">
    Toggle Spot Booking if you want customers to select their own spot during booking. Required to enable the layout view.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Tags & Zone Type" icon="tags">
    Categorize the facility (e.g., Strength Zone, Recovery Bay) for reporting, filters, or business-specific groupings.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Where Facilities Are Used

Facilities are a shared resource across:

| Feature Area     | Use Case                                                       |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Classes**       | Assign rooms to group classes and prevent instructor/room clashes |
| **Appointments**  | Assign therapy rooms or semi-private spaces                   |
| **Courses**       | Inherit linked facility from the class session                |
| **Spot Booking**  | Enable layout view and spot reservation                       |
| **Calendar Views**| Filter by facility to see availability                        |

## Customer View of Facilities

Facilities play a role in customer experience, especially when:

- Using **Spot Booking** (they see the layout image + interactive selector)
- Booking online vs. in-studio classes (based on “Online” toggle)
- Navigating location-based bookings (multi-location setup)

Customers won’t directly select a facility, but it impacts:
- What time slots are shown
- What services are available
- How instructors and classes appear on their calendars

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Clear Facility Names" icon="tag">
    Use labels like “Spin Studio – L1” instead of generic names to reduce admin confusion and improve reporting.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Restrict General Availability" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Limit hours for rooms used by certain appointments (e.g., massage rooms only available 10AM–5PM).
  </Card>

  <Card title="Create Separate Facilities for Spot Booking" icon="table-cells">
    Don’t reuse non-spot facilities for spot-enabled sessions. Spot Booking requires layout, which changes the booking UI.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Color Code by Zone" icon="palette">
    Use consistent color tags (e.g., Green = Recovery, Blue = Strength) for easy calendar visibility.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
