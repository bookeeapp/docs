# Business App Walkthrough

The **Kenko Business App** is designed for instructors, front-desk staff, and managers to carry out day-to-day operations directly from their mobile devices. It’s built for speed, ease, and on-the-go efficiency — while staying tightly integrated with your CRM.

Only the following 4 modules are available on the Business App i.e. \*\*Calendar, Contacts, POS, and Profile\*\*.

All other configurations and features (e.g., setup, analytics, reporting, admin controls) are available only via the main Kenko CRM.

### Core Modules Overview

View and manage daily class schedules, check-ins, and appointment attendance.

```
Filter by Instructor or Facility for ease of use.
```

Access member profiles, visit history, timeline, memberships, and perform key actions like check-in, editing profile or adding note. Sell memberships, packs, and products directly from the app — generate instant receipts. View your profile, attendance, referrals, location, and switch between studios if applicable.

### Calendar Module

See your daily schedule in a mobile-friendly format with date, time, instructor, and booking status clearly listed.

```

Each class tile shows real-time booking counts versus maximum allowed attendance. From any session, you can

```
