## Pro Tips

<Tip>
  - You can hide the native Wix page navigation if you're embedding a full-page booking flow.
  - Add anchor links or buttons on your homepage to lead users to your `/book` section.
  - Want to embed multiple widgets (e.g., class booking \+ pricing)? Add multiple HTML blocks to different sections of your site.
