# Magic Links in Kenko

**Magic Links** are direct URLs that point to a specific product, plan, class, or offer on your Kenko-powered booking interface. Rather than sending clients to a general booking page, you can guide them to the exact place you want them to land.

This makes it easier to create targeted CTAs (calls to action) on your website, emails, social media, or SMS campaigns.

## What Can Magic Links Do?

## How to Generate Magic Links

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Target Page">
    Log in to your Kenko booking site (e.g., yourdomain.gokenko.com/book). Navigate to the specific item—like a membership, class, or pack—you want to highlight.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the Target CTA">
    Click the **Buy Now** or **Book Now** button for that item. This will refresh the page with a unique URL tailored to that exact offering.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the URL">
    Copy the full browser URL. This is your Magic Link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Embed It into Your Website or Campaign">
    Use this URL for your button, banner, or hyperlink on a Squarespace, Wix, or Webflow site.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use in Squarespace Navigation (Example)

If you're building with Squarespace

- Hide the default "book" page from your main menu (`drag → Not Linked`)
- Add new pages for items like "Membership" or "Gift Cards"
- Choose **External Page** as page type
- Paste your Magic Link as the destination URL
- Optional: turn off "Open in New Tab" to keep users on your site

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Always test each Magic Link in an incognito browser to make sure it loads the exact experience you expect, without cache interference.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Use short, compelling button copy like **"Try for \$199"** or **"Book This Class"** instead of generic phrases.
</Tip>
