# Kiosk App for Studios

The **Kenko Kiosk** is a tablet-based check-in interface that allows your members to self-manage their arrivals, sign waivers, and confirm attendance for classes, appointments, and courses — all without needing staff intervention.

It’s designed to reduce front-desk load and streamline member experience while syncing automatically with your Kenko CRM.

<Note>
  The Kiosk feature is available for all Kenko customers and can be launched on any internet-connected tablet.
