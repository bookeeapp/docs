      - Page title
      - Meta description
      - Keywords
    - Remove unnecessary whitespace and save changes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 6: Re-Publish the Site">

## Tips & Troubleshooting

  If you encounter a CNAME or A record conflict, delete existing entries **after backing them up** with a screenshot. Then proceed with the records provided by your website builder.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Use your builder's SEO tools or tag generation features for quick and optimized metadata across all your key pages.
