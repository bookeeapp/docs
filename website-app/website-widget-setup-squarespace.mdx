# Add Kenko Widget to Squarespace

Want to offer seamless booking, memberships, and on-demand content directly through your **Squarespace** site? Here’s how to embed the Kenko widget and set up high-converting navigation.

## Pre-Integration Checklist

Before embedding the widget:

1. Ensure you have **Contributor access** to the client’s Squarespace account.
2. Confirm you can create or edit pages.
3. Ask the client to confirm which navigation links they want to include (e.g., Login, Pricing, Book Class, VOD, etc.).

## Embedding the Kenko Widget

<Steps>

## Using Magic or Static Links

Once embedded, you can use both

- **Static Links**: Predefined URLs like `/login`, `/pricing`, `/videos`
- **Magic Links**: Deep links to specific memberships or offerings (see [Magic Links in Kenko](../website-app/magic-links))

<Note>
  Avoid setting these links to “open in new tab” — it breaks the seamless user experience. Keep all navigation within your domain.
</Note>

## Pro Tips

<Tip>
  Hide generic booking pages and use custom buttons with Magic Links to drive targeted action.

<Tip>
  Use Squarespace’s **External Page** option to build CTA-driven landing pages powered by Kenko links.
