# Kenko Kiosk Setup and Settings

The **Kenko Kiosk** app is your studio’s self-check-in station — a frictionless way for members to mark attendance for classes, appointments, and courses using their own phones.

This article covers everything from pairing devices to fine-tuning check-in behavior and display aesthetics.

## Getting Started with Kenko Kiosk

1. **Download the Kenko Kiosk app** on any iOS or Android tablet/phone.
2. Launch the app and either
   - Scan the on-screen QR code, or
   - Enter the **4-digit digital pairing code** manually.
