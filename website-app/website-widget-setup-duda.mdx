# Embed Kenko Widget into Duda

This guide walks you through how to embed your Kenko booking interface on your Duda-powered website, and how to link specific pages or offerings using static and magic links.

## What Are You Embedding?

You can embed

- A full booking widget (iframe)
- Specific Kenko product links (static or magic)
- Targeted pages like pricing, login, video-on-demand, or even individual class links

## Embedding the Widget in Duda

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Generate Your Widget Embed Code">
    - Go to `Settings → Website Portal → Embed Website`
    - Enter the path you want (e.g., `/book`, `/schedule`)
    - Save your changes and copy the generated `<iframe>` code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Open Duda Website Editor">
    - Navigate to `Marketing → Website Management → Edit Site`
    - A new tab will open with your site editor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Add a New Page">
    - Go to **Pages**
    - Click **Add Page** → choose **Blank Page**
    - Name the page (e.g., `book`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Add the Embed Widget">
    - Open **Widgets** in the left panel
    - Drag and drop an **HTML** widget onto your new page
    - Paste your Kenko `<iframe>` code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Adjust Spacing & Size">
    - If there's too much vertical spacing, reduce widget height to about `70px` padding
    - Resize to best fit the full embedded interface
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 6: Publish the Site">
    - Hit **Publish** in the top-right corner
    - Your new booking page is now live
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Static and Magic Links

You can also direct users to specific parts of your Kenko booking flow without embedding the full widget each time.

### Static Links

These are predefined system URLs such as:

- `/login`
- `/pricing`
- `/my-account`
- `/videos`
- `/class-schedule`
- `/purchase-course`

To use them in Duda

1. Create a **button** or **navigation item**
2. Choose **Link to Web Address**
3. Paste the full static link (e.g., `https://yourstudio.gokenko.com/login`)
4. Uncheck “Open in new tab” to keep users on the site
5. Click away to auto-save

### Magic Links (Deep Links)

Magic links direct users to a **specific class, membership, or pack** — ideal for CTA buttons like _“Buy 5-Class Pack”_ or _“Book This Class”_.

#### How to generate:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1: Publish the Widget Page First">
    Magic links only work on a published site. Make sure your widget or product page is live.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2: Navigate to the Target Product or Class">
    - Visit your live Kenko booking interface (e.g. `/pricing`, `/class-schedule`)
    - Click on the product or class you want to promote
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3: Click the CTA (e.g. Buy Now)">
    This action updates the URL with plan or class ID parameters.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4: Copy the URL from the browser">
    This is your **magic link**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 5: Paste into a Button or Page in Duda">
    Use it in any button on your site (e.g., “Get Membership” → Magic Link)

    - Paste as web address
    - Hit publish again
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Use Cases

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Always uncheck “Open in new tab” when linking within your site to maintain a smooth embedded experience.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Use buttons instead of plain links for better mobile UX and click-throughs.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Use separate Duda pages for different widgets (e.g., book, pricing, videos) for faster load and better organization.
