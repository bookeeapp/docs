# Branded App Walkthrough

The **Kenko Branded App** is a white-labeled mobile application built exclusively for your studio. It allows your members to explore classes, make purchases, manage bookings, and update their personal information — all under your brand.

Available for both **iOS** and **Android**, the branded app enhances engagement, retention, and loyalty.

<Note>
  The Branded App is a **paid add-on** and requires a separate publishing process through the App Store and Google Play. Contact your Kenko representative for pricing and timelines.
