# Quickstart

Welcome to Kenko! Follow these steps to get started with the platform. This guide helps you set up your account and start using key features to streamline your business.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin setting up your Kenko account, make sure you have the following information ready:

* Business name and address
* Payment information and other required business details
* Logo and brand colors (for website widget customization)
* Intro offers for new leads
* Memberships and credit packs for your customers
* Your offerings: classes, appointments, or courses

## Setup Process

If you’re coming from another platform, your setup starts with data migration. Once migration is complete, your account is ready for the rest of the setup. Then, set up your business information and location details in the CRM.

**Region & Location:**

Set up regions (e.g., New York, Los Angeles) and locations (e.g., Downtown Studio, Manhattan Studio) for better business management.

|                | Region                                             | Location                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | A broader geographic or organizational area        | A specific physical facility or business unit       |
| **Scope**      | Can contain multiple locations                     | Belongs to a single region                          |
| **Use case**   | Organize operations across cities or states        | Manage services and staff at a specific site        |
| **Time zone**  | All locations in a region share the same time zone | A location’s time zone is inherited from its region |

Add staff members (instructors, operators, front desk staff) to the CRM. Then invite them via email.

Assign roles and permissions to each team member to control what they can access in the CRM.
