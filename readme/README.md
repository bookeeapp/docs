### Getting started with Kenko

Schedule a demo to explore Kenko and confirm fit. After you move forward, we finalize the contract and start onboarding. If you are migrating from another platform, data migration runs in parallel with your setup.

Typical rollout:

1. Kickoff call with your Account Executive
2. Data migration (runs in parallel with setup)
3. Configure business info, payments, and your branded apps
4. Train your team on core workflows
5. Go live on Kenko
6. Ongoing optimization and support

If you are migrating from another fitness CRM, go-live typically takes **6-8 weeks** from kickoff.
