    To start, go to **New Journeys** in your Kenko dashboard. Youâ€™ll see two options:

    - **Create from Scratch:** Build a fully custom journey tailored to your exact needs.
    - **Use a Template:** Select a pre-built template and customize it quickly.

    Once you select a template, tweak the rules and communication to fit your studio brand. For example, if using the Intro Offer template, select the specific intro offer so only contacts who purchase it enter the journey.

    </Card>
    <Card title="Set 'Send From' Address">
      Use your own email domain for sending messages so customers receive emails from your studio, not a generic Kenko address.

      Ensure buttons in your emails link to the right pages (like booking, membership purchase, etc.).
    </Card>
    <Card title="Create Discounts in Advance">
      If you mention discounts in your messages, create them beforehand to avoid broken links or errors.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Prepare SMS Setup">
      Purchase phone numbers, SMS credits, and complete A2P compliance where required before sending SMS messages.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Use Exit and Goal Filters">
