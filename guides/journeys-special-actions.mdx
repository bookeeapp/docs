# Guide to Special Actions in Journeys

With Kenko Journeys, you have several powerful special actions to control your automated marketing flows efficiently:

- You can **pause** a live journey at any time and **resume** it whenever needed.
- When a journey is paused, **no new contacts will enter the journey**, but existing contacts will continue to progress and receive notifications via email, SMS, and push.
- You can **duplicate** a journey only after it has been saved. Journeys in **Draft**, **Live**, and **Paused** states can be duplicated.
- You can **delete** a journey in any state — Draft, Live, or Paused. Deleting a journey immediately removes all contacts (if any) and stops all future emails, SMS, and push notifications related to that journey.
- If a contact’s **communication preference is turned off (contact unsubscribes)** during a journey, messages for that specific channel will stop immediately.
