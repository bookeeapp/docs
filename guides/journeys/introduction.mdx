# Introduction to Journeys

Journeys in Kenko are structured paths designed to guide your members through a sequence of milestones, making their fitness or wellness experience more engaging and goal-oriented.

## What are Journeys?

  Journeys are customizable, multi-step experiences that transform casual members into devoted clients through structured progression, personalized content, and achievement systems.

Journeys represent a paradigm shift in how your members interact with your studio. Rather than offering disconnected classes or services, Journeys create a cohesive narrative that:

- **Guides members** from beginner to advanced levels
- **Tracks progress** through meaningful milestones
- **Celebrates achievements** to build motivation and commitment
- **Increases retention** by creating long-term engagement goals
