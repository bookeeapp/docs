# Setting Up Your First Journey

Creating a Journey in Kenko is a straightforward process that allows you to design structured experiences for your members. This guide will walk you through each step to create an effective journey.

## Before You Begin

<Note>
Before creating a Journey, it's helpful to outline your goals, target audience, and the key milestones you want members to achieve. This preparation will make the setup process more efficient.
</Note>

Make sure you have:
- Defined the purpose and outcomes of your journey
- Identified your target member segment
- Planned the key stages and timeframe
- Prepared any necessary content or resources

## Journey Setup Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Journey Manager">
    1. Log in to your Kenko dashboard
    2. Navigate to **Marketing > Journeys**
    3. Click the **Create New Journey** button in the top right corner
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Journey Basics">

    </Frame>
    
    Fill in the fundamental details of your journey:
    
    - **Journey Name**: Create a compelling title that communicates the value (e.g., "Yoga Fundamentals Mastery")
    - **Description**: Write a brief overview that explains benefits and expectations
    - **Duration**: Set the expected timeframe (days, weeks, or months)
    - **Capacity**: Determine if there's a member limit (optional)
    - **Target Audience**: Select which member segments can access this journey
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Journey Stages">
    Each journey consists of sequential stages that members progress through:
    
    1. Click **Add Stage** to create each milestone
    2. For each stage, define:
       - Stage name and description
       - Completion criteria (attendance, task completion, etc.)
       - Time expectations (how long this stage should take)
       - Required actions (classes to attend, forms to complete, etc.)
    
    <Tip>
    Most effective journeys have 3-7 stages. Too few stages don't create a sense of progression, while too many can feel overwhelming.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Communications">
    Set up automated communications that will guide members through the journey:
    
    1. Navigate to the **Communications** tab
    2. Create messages for key moments:
       - Journey welcome message
       - Stage completion congratulations
       - Stage transition guidance
       - Encouragement for inactive members
       - Journey completion celebration
    
    <Warning>
    Be mindful of message frequency. Aim to be supportive without overwhelming members with too many notifications.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Rewards and Achievements">
    Create incentives that motivate members to progress:
    
    1. Go to the **Rewards** tab
    2. Configure achievements for:
       - Stage completion badges
       - Special milestones
       - Journey completion rewards
    
    Rewards can include:
    - Digital badges visible on member profiles
    - Certificates of completion
    - Discounts on services or products
    - Exclusive access to special events or content
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview and Test">
    Before launching to your members:
    
    1. Use the **Preview Journey** feature to see the member experience
    2. Click **Test Communications** to receive all journey messages
    3. Verify all links, resources, and instructions
    4. Have a staff member test the complete journey flow
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch Your Journey">
    When you're satisfied with the setup:
    
    1. Set the journey status to **Active**
    2. Choose a launch date
    3. Configure visibility settings (featured on member dashboard, etc.)
    4. Click **Publish Journey**
  </Step>
