# Winback Journey Template: Re-engage Your Lapsed Customers

The **Winback Journey** is your secret weapon to reconnect with customers who haven’t visited your studio in a while — typically 60 days or more. This automated journey reaches out with thoughtful messages, personalized offers, and reminders designed to bring clients back through your doors.

## Why Use the Winback Journey?

Customers can become inactive for many reasons — busy schedules, forgetting, or switching studios. The Winback journey keeps your studio top of mind and entices those clients back with targeted outreach and special deals.

It helps you:

- Recover lost revenue
- Increase repeat visits
- Maintain steady cash flow
- Build stronger customer relationships

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Select the Winback Template">
    Head to **New Journey** in your Kenko dashboard and pick the **Winback** template from the template library.

    This template is pre-built to identify customers who’ve stopped visiting and engage them with winback campaigns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Define Entry Rule — Last Visit More Than X Days Ago">
    Use the **Last Visit Date** filter to automatically select contacts who haven’t visited in over 60 days by default.

    You can customize this timeframe depending on your business needs, such as 30 or 90 days.

    <Info>
      Tip:

       Narrow down by location if you want to target clients by specific studios or branches.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customize Email Messaging">
    Design emails that resonate:

    - Select your sender email from verified addresses.
    - Craft engaging subject lines to improve open rates.
    - Use your studio’s branding with logos, photos, and colors.
    - Add clear CTAs like “Book Your Next Class” or “Claim Your Discount.”

    <Info>
      Make sure you have your SMS credits topped up and A2P compliance completed before enabling SMS blocks.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prepare Discounts and Offers">
    If you plan to offer discounts or promotions in your winback messages:

    - Create them ahead of time in Kenko’s pricing and discounts settings.
    - Link your discount codes correctly in emails, SMS, and push blocks.
    - Test discount redemption flows to ensure smooth customer experience.

    This helps avoid broken links or confusion during campaigns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set Wait Times and Message Cadence">
    Control how often messages are sent by adjusting wait nodes.

    Consider spacing out emails and SMS to avoid overwhelming your clients — for example:

    - Wait 3 days after the first email before sending a reminder.
    - Wait 5 days before sending a final special offer.

    Thoughtful timing improves engagement and reduces unsubscribes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Track Goals and Exits">
    Define goals such as **Pricing Option Purchased** or **New Booking** to measure how many contacts convert thanks to the journey.

    Set exit rules so contacts leave the journey once they meet your goals to avoid redundant messaging.
