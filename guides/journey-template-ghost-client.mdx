# Setting Up Journey Template - Ghost Client Follow-up

Ever notice some customers visit your studio once and then mysteriously disappear? The **Ghost Client Follow-up** journey is designed to help you reconnect with these clients and bring them back — whether with a friendly reminder, a special offer, or just a note that they're missed.

## Why Use the Ghost Client Follow-up Journey?

This journey targets customers who completed their first visit but haven’t returned after a certain period (default 30 days). It’s a proactive way to boost retention by nudging ghost clients to come back, making sure they feel valued and remembered.

## Step-by-Step Setup

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Select the Ghost Client Follow-up Template" icon="plus">
    Click on **New Journey** in Kenko and choose the **Ghost Client Follow-up** template from the library.\
    This template comes pre-configured to identify and engage your ghost clients automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure the Entry Rule – 'First Visit is More Than X Days Ago'" icon="filter">
    Use the **First Visit Date** filter to target customers who haven’t returned since their first visit.\
    By default, this is set to 30 days but you can adjust it to 60 days or any timeframe that fits your studio’s needs.

    <Info>
      Pro Tip:

      Include a discount code or a special offer in your messaging to encourage them to return.

    Customize your emails for a warm, personal touch:

    - Choose your sender email from the dropdown.
    - Update subject lines to capture attention.
    - Add your branding — logos, studio images, button colors.
    - Include clear calls-to-action with links to book or learn more.

    Follow good email design practices to keep your messages engaging and professional.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add SMS and Push Notification Blocks" icon="block">
    To increase your reach, add SMS and Push Notification blocks:

    - SMS messages provide direct, timely nudges.
    - Push notifications are great for quick updates or limited-time offers.

    These multi-channel touchpoints make your follow-up more effective.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prepare Discounts in Advance" icon="tag">
    If you plan to offer discounts or special deals in your journey:

    - Create these discounts in your Kenko system beforehand.
    - Link them properly in your emails, SMS, or push notifications.
    - Test the links and codes to ensure a smooth customer experience.

    This avoids confusion or broken links when your clients try to redeem.
