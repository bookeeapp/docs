# Recording Links for Online Sessions

The **Recording Links** feature allows studio owners and admins to attach session recordings to specific class instancesâ€”giving customers access to replays after their sessions.

<Info>
  Recording links can be added to any online class instance and will be accessible to customers from both the web and mobile app.
</Info>

## Workflow Overview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to Add a Recording Link">
    To add a recording link to a specific online class

    - Go to the class instance in your Kenko admin dashboard
    - Click **Add recording link**
    - Paste the recording URL (e.g. Zoom, Vimeo, YouTube)
    - Click **Save link**

    The link will now be attached to that class instance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How Customers Access the Recording">
    Once the class has ended, customers will see the **View recording** option in their account.

    **From the customer app:**

    - Navigate to **Bookings \> History**
    - Tap on the class
    - Tap **View recording**

    **From the website:**

    - Go to **My Account \> Bookings \> Past**
    - Locate the relevant class
    - Click **View recording**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Use Case

<Card>
  You host an online yoga class via Zoom and want to share the recording with attendees

  - Post-class, go to the class instance
  - Add the Zoom recording link
  - Customers who booked the class can now access it under their past bookings
</Card>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use Persistent URLs">
    Make sure the recording link is stable and does not expire quickly (e.g., Google Drive shareable links, Vimeo links).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add Links Promptly">
    Add the recording link soon after class completion so customers can revisit the session while it's still fresh.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Respect Access Control">
    Only attendees of the class should get access to the recording. Avoid posting links in mass communications.
  </Accordion>
