# Setting Up Journey Template - Client Engagement

The **Client Engagement** journey in Kenko is built to help you go beyond transactions — it’s about cultivating long-term loyalty by staying connected with your clients. From sending studio tips to collecting feedback and celebrating their milestones, this journey builds community and strengthens relationships.

## Why Use the Client Engagement Journey?

<Card>
  New customers often need more than just a great workout — they need to feel welcomed, supported, and valued. The Client Engagement journey keeps your studio top-of-mind and shows customers that you're more than just a service provider.

## How to Set It Up

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Select the Client Engagement Template" icon="plus">
    Start by clicking on New Journey

    in Kenko and select Client Engagement

    from the journey template library. This template includes pre-built blocks designed to improve post-signup communication.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Define the Entry Rule - On Signup" icon="filter">
    Set the entry condition as **Sign Up** and choose the source (e.g. App, Website). Only users who sign up via these sources will enter the journey.

    <Info>
      Pro Tip:

      Add follow-ups like studio tours after signup, email tips after their first visit, and feedback requests after visit #3. This keeps them engaged and informed.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Configure Email Blocks" icon="block">
    Each email should:

    - Be sent from a recognizable sender
    - Have a friendly subject line
    - Include your branding — logos, visuals, button colors
    - Contain relevant links (class booking, about us, FAQs)

    <Card title="Tip for Email Design">
      Make your emails skimmable, visual, and actionable. Use buttons like “Book Your Next Class” or “Meet the Team.”
    </Card>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add SMS & Push Notifications" icon="bell">
    For higher engagement, mix in SMS and Push blocks.

    - **SMS**: Great for visit reminders and urgent nudges
    - **Push Notifications**: Ideal for promoting events or new launches

    <Info>
      Set up SMS compliance and credits in advance to avoid any delays in journey activation.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Create Any Discount Offers" icon="tag">
    If any of your messages include offers or promo codes, be sure to:

    - Create them in your pricing settings first
    - Link them correctly in the journey blocks
    - Test the redemption flow before activating

    <Card title="Why this matters">
      You don’t want clients clicking on a 20% OFF link that leads to an error — make sure the offer is ready to go live.
    </Card>
  </Accordion>
