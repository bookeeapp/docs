# Setting Up Journey Template

The Lead Nurture journey is designed to help you engage and warm up new leads by introducing them to your studio, guiding them to purchase an intro offer, and ultimately encouraging them to book their first class. This journey template automates these interactions, so you can build strong relationships effortlessly.

## How to Set Up the Lead Nurture Journey Template

Follow the steps below to configure and launch the Lead Nurture journey for your studio:

  <Accordion title="Define Entry Rule - Lead Sign Up" icon="filter">
    The entry rule determines who enters this journey. Typically, this is contacts who have just signed up or shown interest.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set Rule Blocks for 'Intro Offer Purchased'" icon="money-bill">
    This rule block checks if the lead has purchased an intro offer. It’s essential to target only those who have committed to your intro package.

  <Accordion title="Configure Email Messaging" icon="pen">
    Emails are the heart of your nurturing. Here’s what you can do:

    - Select the sender email from your verified list.
    - Customize the subject line to grab attention.
    - Personalize email content by adding your logo, studio images, branded colors, and clear call-to-action buttons.

    This builds brand trust and increases engagement.

  <Accordion title="Setup Push Notifications" icon="bell">
    Push notifications provide an additional channel to engage leads instantly.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customize Wait Nodes" icon="hand">
    Wait nodes control the timing between steps. You can adjust these to space out messages based on what you feel is best for your audience.

      Timing is key — too many messages too quickly may overwhelm leads, while too few may cause loss of interest.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add SMS Blocks for Multi-Channel Engagement" icon="message">
    SMS messaging is a powerful way to boost response rates and ensure your leads don’t miss your messages.
