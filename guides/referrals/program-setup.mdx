# Setting Up Your Referral Program

A well-designed referral program can be one of your most powerful marketing tools. This guide will walk you through creating an effective referral system using Kenko's built-in referral management features.

## Why Referrals Matter

<Card title="Referral Program Benefits" icon="handshake">
  Member referrals typically have a 37% higher retention rate and 18% higher lifetime value than members acquired through other channels. They also convert at 4x the rate of other marketing efforts.
</Card>

Referrals are powerful because:
- They come with built-in trust and credibility
- They have lower acquisition costs than paid advertising
- Referred members tend to be higher quality and more loyal
- They strengthen your existing member relationships

## Planning Your Referral Strategy

Before setting up your program technically, define your referral strategy:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Program Goals">
    Determine what you want to achieve:
    - Primary focus: new member acquisition or member retention?
    - Target number of referrals per month
    - Expected conversion rate
    - Budget allocation for incentives
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Design Your Incentives">
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="One-Sided Rewards">
        Offering rewards only to the referring member
        - **Pros**: Simpler to manage, lower cost
        - **Cons**: Less compelling for new prospects
        - **Best for**: Budget-conscious studios or those with very strong word-of-mouth
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Dual-Sided Rewards">
        Rewards for both the referrer and the new member
        - **Pros**: Higher conversion rates, more compelling offer
        - **Cons**: Higher reward costs, more complex to manage
        - **Best for**: Most studios looking for growth
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Tiered Rewards">
        Increasing rewards for members who refer multiple people
        - **Pros**: Encourages multiple referrals, gamifies the process
        - **Cons**: More complex to communicate and manage
        - **Best for**: Established studios with engaged members
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    <Tip>
    The most effective referral programs offer mutual benefits that are meaningful but not excessive. Consider incentives valued at 15-30% of your average monthly membership fee.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Reward Types">
    Select incentives that align with your business model:
    
    <Grid>
      <Card title="Account Credits">
        Apply credit toward membership dues
        - **Pros**: Direct value, no additional costs
        - **Cons**: Less visible/tangible than other rewards
      </Card>
      
      <Card title="Free Sessions">
        Complimentary classes or sessions
        - **Pros**: Low marginal cost, showcases your services
        - **Cons**: Potential scheduling impacts
      </Card>
      
      <Card title="Merchandise">
        Branded products or retail items
        - **Pros**: Tangible, creates walking advertisements
        - **Cons**: Inventory management, may not appeal to all
      </Card>
      
      <Card title="Service Upgrades">
        Premium features or exclusive access
        - **Pros**: Showcases premium offerings, no direct cost
        - **Cons**: May devalue premium services if overused
      </Card>
    </Grid>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Program Rules">
    Define clear terms and conditions:
    - When rewards are earned (at signup, after first payment, etc.)
    - Any limits on rewards per member
    - Referral eligibility (current members only, alumni, etc.)
    - New member requirements to qualify as a valid referral
