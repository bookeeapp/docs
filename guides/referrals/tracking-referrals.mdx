The Referral Analytics Dashboard serves as your command center for monitoring referral program metrics. Access it by navigating to **Marketing > Referral Program > Analytics**.

### Key Performance Metrics

<Grid>
  <div>
    <Metric 
      title="Referral Share Rate" 
      tooltip="Percentage of members who share referrals" 
    />
    Measures member participation in your program. Industry benchmarks suggest aiming for 15-25% of active members sharing referrals.
  </div>
  <div>
    <Metric 
      title="Referral Conversion Rate" 
      tooltip="Percentage of referrals that convert to new members" 
    />
    Typically 3-5x higher than other marketing channels. A healthy rate is 30-40% for fitness businesses.
  </div>
  <div>
    <Metric 
      title="Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)" 
      tooltip="Average cost of acquiring a new member through referrals" 
    />
    Calculated by dividing total rewards distributed by number of new members acquired. Should be significantly lower than other acquisition channels.
  </div>
  <div>
    <Metric 
      title="Referral Program ROI" 
      tooltip="Return on investment for your referral program" 
    />
    Calculated by comparing program costs (rewards + administration) against the lifetime value of referred members.
  </div>
</Grid>

<Tip>
Use the search and filter tools to find specific members, referral dates, or referral statuses. This is especially helpful when addressing member inquiries about referral status.
