# Intro Offer Template

The **Intro Offer Journey** is your follow-up engine after a lead purchases a trial or intro pack. It helps convert new leads into long-term members by sending timely nudges, follow-ups, and incentives.

Think of it as your automated sales assistant â€” checking in, celebrating visits, and pushing for subscriptions, all on autopilot.

## Getting Started
