# Journey Analytics - How to Analyze the Performance of Your Journeys

This article focuses on how to analyze the performance of each communication node in your journeys and track who entered the journey.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Started" icon="play">
    Contacts that entered the journey based on the entry rule.

    Example: A new customer signs up and immediately enters the welcome journey.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="In Progress" icon="arrow-down-up-across-line">
    Contacts currently progressing through the journey.

    Example: A contact has received the first email and is waiting for the next SMS message.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Finished" icon="check">
    Contacts that have completed all steps in the journey.

    Example: A contact has received all the emails, messages, and completed the intended action.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Exited" icon="inbox-out">
    Contacts that left the journey after meeting the exit rules.

    Example: A contact purchased the subscription and was automatically removed from promotional messages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Goal Reached" icon="circle-check">
    Contacts that achieved the journey's goal.

    Example: A contact completed a booking or purchased a product as intended by the journey.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Disengaged" icon="x">
    Contacts removed from the journey due to incorrect communication details or unmet rules.

</AccordionGroup>

<Steps>
  <Step title="View the Performance">
    Go to the journey you’ve set live, and click on the **"View Performance"** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the Analytics">
    On the analytics page, you’ll find insights for both communication blocks and contacts. Let’s dive into what each section means:

    Under **Communication Analytics**, you can view the reach of each communication block:

    - **Email Block:** Number of contacts who were supposed to receive the email, delivered count, opened count, and clicked links.
    - **SMS Block:** Number of contacts SMS was sent to, delivered, undelivered, or marked invalid.
    - **Push Notification Block:** Number of contacts who received push notifications and clicks on them.

    You can toggle between **absolute** and **percentage** views for clearer performance understanding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Contacts">
    To get more insights on individual contacts, go to the **Contacts** tab. You’ll see status of each contact — whether they are **In Progress** or have **Completed** the journey.

    For deeper analysis, click on any specific contact to see:

    - When they started the journey.
    - Whether they’ve reached the goal.
    - Whether they’ve finished or exited the journey.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  In future updates, you’ll be able to see specific recipients of each communication block and track which contact is on which block. This will provide even more detailed journey node-level analytics for deeper insights into each step of your automations.
