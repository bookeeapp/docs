# Journey Guidelines & Fair Usage Policy

To ensure you get the best possible results from your Journeys, we’ve established some important guidelines and fair usage policies. These are designed to maintain system performance, reliability, and fairness for all users.

## Key Guidelines and Limits

 1. **Token Limit**\
    Each month, your account receives **10,000 tokens**. This limits the total number of unique audience members who can enter or re-enter any of your Journeys during that period, helping to manage subscription-level usage effectively.
 2. **Live Journeys**\
    You may have up to **5 active Journeys** running simultaneously. This ensures manageable workloads and maintains high-quality performance.
 3. **Rule Blocks**\
    Each Journey supports up to **5 rule blocks**, allowing you to define precise conditions without overcomplicating your automation.
 4. **Wait Blocks**\
    Similarly, each automation can have up to **5 wait blocks**, which help pace your communications effectively.
 5. **Email Deliverability Management**\
    If emails sent through your Journeys are marked as spam or bounce back, the affected user’s Journey will be paused to protect your deliverability and maintain smooth operation.
 6. **Regular System Checks**\
    Internal checks on rules, messages, waits, and tags run every 90 minutes to keep your Journeys aligned with the latest conditions.
 7. **Workflow Capacity Control**\
    Filter-based workflows are limited to processing **1,000 individuals every 30 minutes** per iteration, preventing overload and ensuring consistent performance.
 8. **Filter Evaluation Frequency**\
    Rules and exit conditions for Journeys are evaluated every 6 hours, ensuring your automation stays up-to-date with current data.
 9. **Re-entry Rules**\
    Contacts can re-enter Journeys but only after completing, disengaging from, or exiting the current workflow. A minimum 24-hour wait period is required between interactions.
10. **Data Refresh Rate**\
    Journey data is refreshed hourly, providing you with the latest information for accurate decision-making.
11. **Event-Based Rule Limits**\
    Each automation supports a single event-based rule to maintain clarity and simplicity.
12. **Duration Cap**\
    The maximum total duration for any automation, including wait times, is capped at **1 year** to keep Journeys timely and relevant.
13. **Analytics Update Interval**\
    Analytics on entries, exits, disengagements, and completions are updated every 5 minutes, delivering near real-time insights.
14. **Clear Titles Best Practice**\
    Naming your automation blocks with clear, descriptive titles is highly recommended for easy navigation and quick understanding of your Journeys.
